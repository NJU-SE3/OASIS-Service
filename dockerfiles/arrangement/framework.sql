INSERT INTO `paper` VALUES (1,'Background: Statistical concepts and techniques are often applied incorrectly, even in mature disciplines such as medicine or psychology. Surprisingly, there are very few works that study statistical problems in software engineering (SE). Aim: Assess the existence of statistical errors in SE experiments. Method: Compile the most common statistical errors in experimental disciplines. Survey experiments published in ICSE to assess whether errors occur in high quality SE publications. Results: The same errors as identified in others disciplines were found in ICSE experiments, where 30 of the reviewed papers included several error types such as: a) missing statistical hypotheses, b) missing sample size calculation, c) failure to assess statistical test assumptions, and d) uncorrected multiple testing. This rather large error rate is greater for research papers where experiments are confined to the validation section. The origin of the errors can be traced back to: a) researchers not having sufficient statistical training, and b) a profusion of exploratory research. Conclusions: This paper provides preliminary evidence that SE research suffers from the same statistical problems as other experimental disciplines. However, the SE community appears to be unaware of any shortcomings in its experiments, whereas other disciplines work hard to avoid these threats. Further research is necessary to find the underlying causes and set up corrective measures, but there are some potentially effective actions and are a priori easy to implement: a) improve the statistical training of SE researchers, and b) enforce quality assessment and reporting guidelines in SE publications.',0,'Literature review;Survey;Prevalence;Statistical errors',0,'Software engineering;Bibliographies;Training;Guidelines;Error analysis;Back,psychology;research and development;software engineering;statistical testing,software engineering experiments;SE experiments;high quality SE publications;ICSE experiments;statistical hypotheses;statistical test assumptions;SE community;SE researchers;quality assessment;statistical errors;statistical training;SE research','Statistical Errors in Software Engineering Experiments: A Preliminary Literature Review'),(14,'Despite their significant advantages, formal methods are not widely used in industrial software development. Following the successful workshops we organized at ICSE 2103 in San Francisco, and ICSE 2014 in Hyderabad, we organize a third edition of the FormaliSE workshop with the main goal to promote the integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities.',0,'Formal methods;Software engineering',0,'Software;Conferences;Software engineering;Security;Committees;Industries;Collaboration,,','3rd FME Workshop on Formal Methods in Software Engineering (FormaliSE 2015)'),(20,'Exploiting machine learning techniques for analyzing programs has attracted much attention. One key problem is how to represent code fragments well for follow-up analysis. Traditional information retrieval based methods often treat programs as natural language texts, which could miss important semantic information of source code. Recently, state-of-the-art studies demonstrate that abstract syntax tree (AST) based neural models can better represent source code. However, the sizes of ASTs are usually large and the existing models are prone to the long-term dependency problem. In this paper, we propose a novel AST-based Neural Network (ASTNN) for source code representation. Unlike existing models that work on entire ASTs, ASTNN splits each large AST into a sequence of small statement trees, and encodes the statement trees to vectors by capturing the lexical and syntactical knowledge of statements. Based on the sequence of statement vectors, a bidirectional RNN model is used to leverage the naturalness of statements and finally produce the vector representation of a code fragment. We have applied our neural network based source code representation method to two common program comprehension tasks: source code classification and code clone detection. Experimental results on the two tasks indicate that our model is superior to state-of-the-art approaches.',1,'Abstract Syntax Tree, source code representation, neural network, code classification, code clone detection',66,'Syntactics;Cloning;Semantics;Neural networks;Task analysis;Binary trees;Natural languages,information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;program diagnostics;recurrent neural nets;text analysis;tree data structures,abstract syntax tree;code fragment;natural language texts;ASTNN;statement trees;statement vectors;bidirectional RNN model;vector representation;source code representation method;source code classification;code clone detection;program analysis;program comprehension tasks;AST-based Neural Network;neural source code representation;information retrieval;machine learning','A Novel Neural Source Code Representation Based on Abstract Syntax Tree'),(43,'Testing configurable systems is important and challenging due to the enormous space of configurations where errors can hide. Existing approaches to test these systems are often costly or unreliable. This paper proposes S-SPLat, a technique that combines heuristic sampling with symbolic search to obtain both breadth and depth in the exploration of the configuration space. S-SPLat builds on SPLat, our previously developed technique, that explores all reachable configurations from tests. In contrast to its predecessor, S-SPLat sacrifices soundness in favor of efficiency. We evaluated our technique on eight software product lines of various sizes and on a large configurable system - GCC. Considering the results for GCC, S-SPLat was able to reproduce all five bugs that we previously found in a previous study with SPLat but much faster and it was able to find two new bugs in a recent release of GCC. Results suggest that it is preferable to use a combination of simple heuristics to drive the symbolic search as opposed to a single heuristic. S-SPLat and our experimental infrastructure are publicly available.',1,'sampling;testing;configuration',52,'Testing;Computer bugs;Software product lines;Complexity theory;Reliability;Space exploration,program testing;software product lines,configurable system testing;S-SPLat technique;heuristic sampling;symbolic search;configuration space;software product lines;GCC','Balancing Soundness and Efficiency for Practical Testing of Configurable Systems'),(53,'Program obfuscation is a common practice in software development to obscure source code or binary code, in order to prevent humans from understanding the purpose or logic of software. It protects intellectual property and deters malicious attacks. While tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of various obfuscation techniques, we have relatively little knowledge on how to most effectively use them together. The biggest challenge lies in identifying the most effective combination of obfuscation techniques. This paper presents a unified framework to optimize program obfuscation. Given an input program P and a set T of obfuscation transformations, our technique can automatically identify a sequence seq = 〈t1, t2, ..., tn〉 (∀i ∈ [1, n]. ti ∈ T), such that applying ti in order on P yields the optimal obfuscation performance. We model the process of searching for seq as a mathematical optimization problem. The key technical contributions of this paper are: (1) an obscurity language model to assess obfuscation effectiveness/optimality, and (2) a guided stochastic algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to search for the optimal solution seq.

However, currently there is a lack of testing tools for evaluating the energy properties of apps. We present COBWEB, a search-based energy testing technique for Android. By leveraging a set of novel models, representing both the functional behavior of an app as well as the contextual conditions affecting the app\'s energy behavior, COBWEB generates a test suite that can effectively find energy defects.

CTD provides automatic test plan generation, but it requires a manual definition of the test space in the form of a combinatorial model. As the system under test evolves, e.g., due to iterative development processes and bug fixing, so does the test space, and thus, in the context of CTD, evolution translates into frequent manual model definition updates. Manually reasoning about the differences between versions of real-world models following such updates is infeasible due to their complexity and size. Moreover, representing the differences is challenging. In this work, we propose a first syntactic and semantic differencing technique for combinatorial models of test designs. We define a concise and canonical representation for differences between two models, and suggest a scalable algorithm for automatically computing and presenting it. We use our differencing technique to analyze the evolution of 42 real-world industrial models, demonstrating its applicability and scalability. Further, a user study with 16 CTD practitioners shows that comprehension of differences between real-world combinatorial model versions is challenging and that our differencing tool significantly improves the performance of less experienced practitioners.

However, such the heuristic approach is based on several assumptions, which pose common threats to the validity of many studies. In this paper, we set out to investigate the nature of the difference of defect datasets generated by the heuristic approach and the realistic approach that leverages the earliest affected release that is realistically estimated by a software development team for a given defect. In addition, we investigate the impact of defect identification approaches on the predictive accuracy and the ranking of defective modules that are produced by defect models. Through a case study of defect datasets of 32 releases, we find that that the heuristic approach has a large impact on both defect count datasets and binary defect datasets. Surprisingly, we find that the heuristic approach has a minimal impact on defect count models, suggesting that future work should not be too concerned about defect count models that are constructed using heuristic defect datasets.

The latter needs the prior knowledge of known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible framework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through program metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known vulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically derived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a target application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to rank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially vulnerable.

While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning how to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the types of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our goal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn how to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull requests.

Most existing JIT-SDP work assumes that the characteristics of the problem remain the same over time. However, JIT-SDP may suffer from class imbalance evolution. Specifically, the imbalance status of the problem (i.e., how much underrepresented the defect-inducing changes are) may be intensified or reduced over time. If occurring, this could render existing JIT-SDP approaches unsuitable, including those that re-build classifiers over time using only recent data. This work thus provides the first investigation of whether class imbalance evolution poses a threat to JIT-SDP. This investigation is performed in a realistic scenario by taking into account verification latency -- the often overlooked fact that labeled training examples arrive with a delay. Based on 10 GitHub projects, we show that JIT-SDP suffers from class imbalance evolution, significantly hindering the predictive performance of existing JIT-SDP approaches.

Many techniques have been proposed to facilitate automated compiler testing. These techniques rely on a large number of test programs (which are test inputs of compilers) generated by some test-generation tools (e.g., CSmith). However, these compiler testing techniques have serious efficiency problems as they usually take a long period of time to find compiler bugs. To accelerate compiler testing, it is desirable to prioritize the generated test programs so that the test programs that are more likely to trigger compiler bugs are executed earlier. In this paper, we propose the idea of learning to test, which learns the characteristics of bug-revealing test programs from previous test programs that triggered bugs. Based on the idea of learning to test, we propose LET, an approach to prioritizing test programs for compiler testing acceleration. LET consists of a learning process and a scheduling process. In the learning process, LET identifies a set of features of test programs, trains a capability model to predict the probability of a new test program for triggering compiler bugs and a time model to predict the execution time of a test program. In the scheduling process, LET prioritizes new test programs according to their bug-revealing probabilities in unit time, which is calculated based on the two trained models. Our extensive experiments show that LET significantly accelerates compiler testing. In particular, LET reduces more than 50% of the testing time in 24.64% of the cases, and reduces between 25% and 50% of the testing time in 36.23% of the cases.',2,'',79,'Computer bugs;Testing;Program processors;Life estimation;Feature extraction;Training;Predictive models,learning (artificial intelligence);program compilers;program testing;scheduling;software reliability,compiler reliability;software systems;automated compiler testing;test-generation tools;compiler bugs;bug-revealing test programs;LET;learning process;scheduling process;time model;bug-revealing probabilities','Learning to Prioritize Test Programs for Compiler Testing'),(308,'Existing software-history techniques represent source-code evolution as an absolute and unambiguous mapping of lines of code in prior revisions to lines of code in subsequent revisions.

Different from most previous methods which classify detected library candidates based on similarity comparison, our method is based on feature hashing and can better handle code whose package and method names are obfuscated.

Although effective, ZOP has several shortcomings: it requires test inputs that achieve extensive code coverage for its training phase; it predicts path profiles instead of complete execution traces; and its predictions can suffer unrecoverable accuracy losses. In this paper, we present zero-overhead path prediction (ZOP-2), an approach that extends ZOP and addresses its limitations. First, ZOP-2 achieves high coverage during training through progressive symbolic execution (PSE)-symbolic execution of increasingly small program fragments. Second, ZOP-2 predicts complete execution traces, rather than path profiles. Finally, ZOP-2 mitigates the problem of path mispredictions by using a stateless approach that can recover from prediction errors. We evaluated our approach on a set of benchmarks with promising results; for the cases considered, (1) ZOP-2 achieved over 90% path prediction accuracy, and (2) PSE covered feasible paths missed by traditional symbolic execution, thus boosting ZOP-2\'s accuracy.',0,'symbolic execution;path profiling;tracing',49,'Training;Predictive models;Instruments;Electromagnetics;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Microsoft Windows,program testing;symbol manipulation,symbolic execution;path prediction accuracy;electromagnetic emissions;computer hardware;extensive code coverage;path mispredictions;progressive symbolic execution;zero-overhead profiling;prediction errors;zero-overhead path prediction;complete execution traces;path profiles','Zero-Overhead Path Prediction with Progressive Symbolic Execution'),(360,'Quality assurance automation is essential in modern software development.

Data and analytics of the pros and cons can inform these decisions. Yet, in most cases, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of existing practices and tool choices. We propose a general methodology to model the time-dependent effect of automation tool choice on four outcomes of interest: prevalence of issues, code churn, number of pull requests, and number of contributors, all with a multitude of controls. On a large data set of npm JavaScript projects, we extract the adoption events for popular tools in three task classes: linters, dependency managers, and coverage reporters. Using mixed methods approaches, we study the reasons for the adoptions and compare the adoption effects within each class, and sequential tool adoptions across classes.

In order to produce the valid objects to train the network, an assumed-correct set of object building routines is randomly executed. Invalid instances are produced by generating values for object fields that \"break\" the collected valid values, i.e., that assign values to object fields that have not been observed as feasible in the assumed-correct executions that led to the collected valid instances.

One approach to find such errors is to use formal verification techniques. However, as a first step, most formal verification techniques require extraction of a formal model which is a difficult problem in itself due to dynamic features of modern languages, and it is typically done either manually, or using ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a technique called symbolic model extraction for extracting formal data models from web applications. The key ideas of symbolic model extraction are 1) to use the source language interpreter for model extraction, which enables us to handle dynamic features of the language, 2) to use code instrumentation so that execution of each instrumented piece of code returns the formal model that corresponds to that piece of code, 3) to instrument the code dynamically so that the models of methods that are created at runtime can also be extracted, and 4) to execute both sides of branches during instrumented execution so that all program behaviors can be covered in a single instrumented execution.

However, manually creating catalogs of transformations is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we present REFAZER, a technique for automatically learning program transformations. REFAZER builds on the observation that code edits performed by developers can be used as input-output examples for learning program transformations. Example edits may share the same structure but involve different variables and subexpressions, which must be generalized in a transformation at the right level of abstraction. To learn transformations, REFAZER leverages state-of-the-art programming-by-example methodology using the following key components: (a) a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for describing program transformations, (b) domain-specific deductive algorithms for efficiently synthesizing transformations in the DSL, and (c) functions for ranking the synthesized transformations. We instantiate and evaluate REFAZER in two domains. First, given examples of code edits used by students to fix incorrect programming assignment submissions, we learn program transformations that can fix other students\' submissions with similar faults. In our evaluation conducted on 4 programming tasks performed by 720 students, our technique helped to fix incorrect submissions for 87% of the students. In the second domain, we use repetitive code edits applied by developers to the same project to synthesize a program transformation that applies these edits to other locations in the code.

However, the atomicity of an atomic event group is not guaranteed by Node.js, and thus other events may interrupt the execution of the atomic event group, break down the atomicity and cause unexpected results. Existing approaches mainly focus on event race among two events, and cannot detect high-level atomicity violations among a group of events.

We make two observations on the discovery of API misuse patterns. First, API misuses can be represented as mutants of the corresponding correct usages. Second, whether a mutant will introduce a misuse can be validated via executing it against a test suite and analyzing the execution information. Based on these observations, we propose MutApi, the first approach to discovering API misuse patterns via mutation analysis. To effectively mimic API misuses based on correct usages, we first design eight effective mutation operators inspired by the common characteristics of API misuses.

We trained 360 different configurations of the tracing network using existing trace links in the Positive Train Control domain and identified the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BI-GRU) as the best model for the tracing task.

To locate the bugs in control-CPSs, SFL tools often demand many labeled (\"correct\"/\"incorrect\") source code execution traces as inputs. To label the correctness of these traces, we must judge the corresponding control-CPS physical trajectories\' correctness. However, unlike discrete outputs, the boundaries between correct and incorrect physical trajectories are often vague. The mechanism (aka oracle) to judge the physical trajectories\' correctness thus becomes a major challenge. So far, the ad hoc practice of ``human oracles\'\' is still widely used, whose qualities heavily depend on the human experts\' expertise and availability. This paper proposes an oracle based on the well adopted autoregressive system identification (AR-SI). With proven success for controlling black-box physical systems, AR-SI is adapted by us to identify the buggy control-CPS as a black-box. We use this identification result as an oracle to judge the control-CPS\'s behaviors, and propose a methodology to prepare traces for control-CPS debugging. Comprehensive evaluations on classic control-CPSs with injected real-life and artificial bugs show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the human oracle approach in SFL accuracy (recall) and latency, and in oracle false positive/negative rates.

In order to achieve efficient and correct builds, developers must provide the build tools with dependency information between the files and modules of a project, usually expressed in a macro language specific to each build tool. In order to guarantee correctness, the authors of these tools are responsible for enumerating all the files whose contents an output depends on. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process and not all dependencies are captured in practice, which leads to incorrect builds. We automatically uncover such missing dependencies through a novel method that we call build fuzzing. The correctness of build definitions is verified by modifying files in a project, triggering incremental builds and comparing the set of changed files to the set of expected changes. These sets are determined using a dependency graph inferred by tracing the system calls executed during a clean build. We evaluate our method by exhaustively testing build rules of open-source projects, uncovering issues leading to race conditions and faulty builds in 31 of them. We provide a discussion of the bugs we detect, identifying anti-patterns in the use of the macro languages.

Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus.

This significantly limits the effective use of programming screencasts in downstream applications. In this paper, we are the first to present a novel technique for recognizing workflow actions in programming screencasts. Our technique exploits image differencing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the correspondence and change of consecutive frames, based on which nine classes of frequent developer actions can be recognized from programming screencasts.

However, little attention has been devoted to assessing the reliability of code coverage tools. In this study, we propose a randomized differential testing approach to hunting for bugs in the most widely used C code coverage tools. Specifically, by generating random input programs, our approach seeks for inconsistencies in code coverage reports produced by different code coverage tools, and then identifies inconsistencies as potential code coverage bugs. To effectively report code coverage bugs, we addressed three specific challenges: (1) How to filter out duplicate test programs as many of them triggering the same bugs in code coverage tools; (2) how to automatically reduce large test programs to much smaller ones that have the same properties; and (3) how to determine which code coverage tools have bugs? The extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, resulting in 42 and 28 confirmed/fixed bugs for gcov and llvm-cov, respectively. This case study indicates that code coverage tools are not as reliable as it might have been envisaged. It not only demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, but also highlights the need to continue improving the reliability of code coverage tools.

Good completion tools can not only save time and effort but may also help avoid incorrect API usage. Many proposed completion tools have shown promising results on synthetic benchmarks, but these benchmarks make no claims about the realism of the completions they test. This lack of grounding in real-world data could hinder our scientific understanding of developer needs and of the efficacy of completion models. This paper presents a case study on 15,000 code completions that were applied by 66 real developers, which we study and contrast with artificial completions to inform future research and tools in this area. We find that synthetic benchmarks misrepresent many aspects of real-world completions; tested completion tools were far less accurate on real-world data. Worse, on the few completions that consumed most of the developers\' time, prediction accuracy was less than 20% -- an effect that is invisible in synthetic benchmarks. Our findings have ramifications for future benchmarks, tool design and real-world efficacy: Benchmarks must account for completions that developers use most, such as intra-project APIs; models should be designed to be amenable to intra-project data; and real-world developer trials are essential to quantifying performance on the least predictable completions, which are both most time-consuming and far more typical than artificial data suggests.

Such inconsistencies in the documents inevitably confuse the API users hampering considerably their API comprehension and the quality of software built from such APIs. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to detect defects of API documents by leveraging techniques from program comprehension and natural language processing. Particularly, we focus on the directives of the API documents which are related to parameter constraints and exception throwing declarations. A first-order logic based constraint solver is employed to detect such defects based on the obtained analysis results. We evaluate our approach on parts of well documented JDK 1.8 APIs.

Thus, it is critical to ensure the reliability and robustness of popular JVM implementations. However, little research exists on validating production JVMs. One notable effort is classfuzz, which mutates Java bytecode syntactically to stress-test different JVMs. It is shown that classfuzz mainly produces illegal bytecode files and uncovers defects in JVMs\' startup processes. It remains a challenge to effectively test JVMs\' bytecode verifiers and execution engines to expose deeper bugs. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing classming, a novel, effective approach to performing deep, differential JVM testing. The key of classming is a technique, live bytecode mutation, to generate, from a seed bytecode file f, likely valid, executable (live) bytecode files: (1) capture the seed f\'s live bytecode, the sequence of its executed bytecode instructions; (2) repeatedly manipulate the control- and data-flow in f\'s live bytecode to generate semantically different mutants; and (3) selectively accept the generated mutants to steer the mutation process toward live, diverse mutants. The generated mutants are then employed to differentially test JVMs. We have evaluated classming on mainstream JVM implementations, including OpenJDK\'s HotSpot and IBM\'s J9, by mutating the DaCapo benchmarks. Our results show that classming is very effective in uncovering deep JVM differences. More than 1,800 of the generated classes exposed JVM differences, and more than 30 triggered JVM crashes. We analyzed and reported the JVM runtime differences and crashes, of which 14 have already been confirmed/fixed, including a highly critical security vulnerability in J9 that allowed untrusted code to disable the security manager and elevate its privileges (CVE-2017-1376).',0,'Differential JVM testing;live bytecode mutation;semantically different mutants',49,'Monitoring;Testing;Java;Engines;Security;Computer crashes;Runtime,Java;program testing;program verification;security of data;source code (software);virtual machines,Java Virtual Machine;Java platform;classfuzz;classming;differential JVM testing;live bytecode mutation;mutation process;deep JVM differences;JVM crashes;bytecode instructions;deep differential testing;OpenJDK HotSpot;IBM J9;DaCapo benchmarks;deeper bugs','Deep Differential Testing of JVM Implementations'),(729,'Snippets of logging code are output statements (e.g., LOG.info or System.out.println) that developers insert into a software system. Although more logging code can provide more execution context of the system\'s behavior during runtime, it is undesirable to instrument the system with too much logging code due to maintenance overhead. Furthermore, excessive logging may cause unexpected side-effects like performance slow-down or high disk I/O bandwidth. Recent studies show that there are no well-defined coding guidelines for performing effective logging. Previous research on the logging code mainly tackles the problems of where-to-log and what-to-log. There are very few works trying to address the problem of how-to-log (developing and maintaining high-quality logging code). In this paper, we study the problem of how-to-log by characterizing and detecting the anti-patterns in the logging code. As the majority of the logging code is evolved together with the feature code, the remaining set of logging code changes usually contains the fixes to the anti-patterns. We have manually examined 352 pairs of independently changed logging code snippets from three well-maintenance open source systems: ActiveMQ, Hadoop and Maven. Our analysis has resulted in six different anti-patterns in the logging code. To demonstrate the value of our findings, we have encoded these anti-patterns into a static code analysis tool, LCAnalyzer.

Our approach aims to strike a balance between these two approaches by selectively allowing unsoundness only when it is likely to reduce false alarms, while retaining true alarms. We use an anomaly-detection technique to learn such harmless unsoundness. We implemented our technique in two static analyzers for full C.

Operational profile-based testing is a black-box technique that selects test cases having the largest impact on failure probability in operation, as such, it is considered well suited when reliability is a major concern. Program spectrum is a characterization of a program\'s behavior in terms of the code entities (e.g., branches, statements, functions) that are covered as the program executes. The driving idea of covrel is to complement operational profile information with white-box coverage measures based on count spectra, so as to dynamically select the most effective test cases for reliability improvement.

For instance, to find the fastest configuration for a given setting, a brute-force strategy measures the performance of all configurations, which is typically intractable. Addressing this challenge, state-of-the-art strategies rely on machine learning, analyzing only a few configurations (i.e., a sample set) to predict the performance of other configurations. However, to obtain accurate performance predictions, a representative sample set of configurations is required. Addressing this task, different sampling strategies have been proposed, which come with different advantages (e.g., covering the configuration space systematically) and disadvantages (e.g., the need to enumerate all configurations). In our experiments, we found that most sampling strategies do not achieve a good coverage of the configuration space with respect to covering relevant performance values. That is, they miss important configurations with distinct performance behavior. Based on this observation, we devise a new sampling strategy, called distance-based sampling, that is based on a distance metric and a probability distribution to spread the configurations of the sample set according to a given probability distribution across the configuration space. This way, we cover different kinds of interactions among configuration options in the sample set. To demonstrate the merits of distance-based sampling, we compare it to state-of-the-art sampling strategies, such as t-wise sampling, on 10 real-world configurable software systems. Our results show that distance-based sampling leads to more accurate performance models for medium to large sample sets.',3,'Distance Based Sampling;Configuration Sampling;Configurable Systems;Performance Modeling',36,'Software systems;Sociology;Statistics;Probability distribution;Task analysis;Performance evaluation,learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;statistical distributions,sampling strategy;configuration options;t-wise sampling;real-world configurable software systems;software configuration;brute-force strategy;representative sample set;distance-based sampling;sampling strategies;software configuration space;probability distribution','Distance-Based Sampling of Software Configuration Spaces'),(894,'Side-channel attacks allow an adversary to uncover secret program data by observing the behavior of a program with respect to a resource, such as execution time, consumed memory or response size.

DifFuzz automatically detects these vulnerabilities by analyzing two versions of the program and using resource-guided heuristics to find inputs that maximize the difference in resource consumption between secret-dependent paths. The methodology of DifFuzz is general and can be applied to programs written in any language.

These exceptions are an important factor to consider for license compliance analysis since they modify the standard (and widely understood) terms of the original license.

The problem is that, it remains unclear whether these different dependency relations will present similar accuracy in terms of defect prediction and localization. In this paper, we present our systematic investigation of this question from the perspective of software architecture. Considering files involved in each dependency type as an individual design space, we model such a design space using one DRSpace. We derived 3 DRSpaces for each of the 117 Apache open source projects, with 643,079 revision commits and 101,364 bug reports in total, and calculated their interactions with defective files.

The good news is that the combination of these structures has the potential to improve the accuracy of defect prediction/localization.

Each technique represents the software artifacts of features differently, typically classified into annotative (e.g., C preprocessor) and modular representations (e.g., feature modules), each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Annotative representations are easy to realize, but annotations clutter source code and hinder program comprehension. Modular representations support comprehension, but are difficult to realize. Most importantly, to engineer feature artifacts, developers need to choose one representation and adhere to it for evolving and maintaining the same artifacts.

It then selects and runs appropriate statistical tests that can, with high confidence, determine if the implementation satisfies the specification.

In other words, previous research has determined which fault localization techniques are best at finding artificial faults.

We implement ZenIDS as a PHP extension supported by 8 hooks instrumented in the PHP interpreter. Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness monitoring live web traffic for one year to 3 large PHP applications, detecting malicious requests with a false positive rate of less than .01% after training on fewer than 4,000 requests.

When applying similar edits to clones, developers often find it difficult to examine the runtime behavior of clones. The problem is exacerbated when some clones are tested, while their counterparts are not. To reuse tests for similar but not identical clones, Grafter transplants one clone to its counterpart by (1) identifying variations in identifier names, types, and method call targets, (2) resolving compilation errors caused by such variations through code transformation, and (3) inserting stub code to transfer input data and intermediate output values for examination. To help developers examine behavioral differences between clones, Grafter supports fine-grained differential testing at both the test outcome level and the intermediate program state level. In our evaluation on three open source projects, Grafter successfully reuses tests in 94% of clone pairs without inducing build errors, demonstrating its automated code transplantation capability. To examine the robustness of G RAFTER, we systematically inject faults using a mutation testing tool, Major, and detect behavioral differences induced by seeded faults. Compared with a static cloning bug finder, Grafter detects 31% more mutants using the test-level comparison and almost 2X more using the state-level comparison.

We present a parallel refinement framework which employs multiple engines to refine the abstraction in parallel. Different from existing work which parallelizes the search process, our method achieves the effect of parallelization by refinement constraint and learnt clause sharing, so that the number of required iterations can be significantly reduced.

At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a highlevel 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract\'s source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts. Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts - e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler.

Existing algorithms relying on syntactic similarity have lower accuracy, and cannot effectively detect semantic change patterns. We introduce a novel graph-based mining approach, CPatMiner, to detect previously unknown repetitive changes in the wild, by mining fine-grained semantic code change patterns from a large number of repositories. To overcome unique challenges such as detecting meaningful change patterns and scaling to large repositories, we rely on fine-grained change graphs to capture program dependencies. We evaluate CPatMiner by mining change patterns in a diverse corpus of 5,000+ open-source projects from GitHub across a population of 170,000+ developers. We use three complementary methods. First, we sent the mined patterns to 108 open-source developers. We found that 70% of respondents recognized those patterns as their meaningful frequent changes. Moreover, 79% of respondents even named the patterns, and 44% wanted future IDEs to automate such repetitive changes. We found that the mined change patterns belong to various development activities: adaptive (9%), perfective (20%), corrective (35%) and preventive (36%, including refactorings).

However, existing coverage criteria are not sufficiently fine grained to capture subtle behaviours exhibited by DL systems. Moreover, evaluations have focused on showing correlation between adversarial examples and proposed criteria rather than evaluating and guiding their use for actual testing of DL systems.

RTSCheck uses three components to obtain evolving programs: (1) AutoEP automatically generates evolving programs and corresponding tests, (2) DefectsEP uses buggy and fixed program revisions from bug databases, and (3) EvoEP uses sequences of program revisions from actual open-source projects\' histories. We used RTSCheck to check three recently developed RTS tools for Java: Clover, Ekstazi, and STARTS.

Such test alarms lay an almost unbearable burden on software testing engineers who have to manually analyze the causes of these alarms. The causes are critical because they decide which stakeholders are responsible to fix the bugs detected during the testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach that aims to relieve the burden by automating the procedure. Our approach, called Cause Analysis Model, exploits information retrieval techniques to efficiently infer test alarm causes based on test logs. We have developed a prototype and evaluated our tool on two industrial datasets with more than 14,000 test alarms. Experiments on the two datasets show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 58.3% and 65.8%, respectively, which outperforms the baseline algorithms by up to 13.3%. Our algorithm is also extremely efficient, spending about 0.1s per cause analysis. Due to the attractive experimental results, our industrial partner, a leading information and communication technology company in the world, has deployed the tool and it achieves an average accuracy of 72% after two months of running, nearly three times more accurate than a previous strategy based on regular expressions.',7,'software testing;system and integration testing;test alarm analysis;multiclass classification',51,'Software;Computer bugs;Product codes;Instruments;Software testing;Analytical models,information retrieval;program diagnostics;program testing,automatic cause analysis;system and integration testing;test alarms;cause analysis model;information retrieval techniques;test logs;SIT','What Causes My Test Alarm?

JavaScript is also a dynamically typed language for which static type systems, notably Facebook\'s Flow and Microsoft\'s TypeScript, have been written. What benefits do these static type systems provide? Leveraging JavaScript project histories, we select a fixed bug and check out the code just prior to the fix. We manually add type annotations to the buggy code and test whether Flow and TypeScript report an error on the buggy code, thereby possibly prompting a developer to fix the bug before its public release. We then report the proportion of bugs on which these type systems reported an error. Evaluating static type systems against public bugs, which have survived testing and review, is conservative: it understates their effectiveness at detecting bugs during private development, not to mention their other benefits such as facilitating code search/completion and serving as documentation.

While cheap at first, it increases maintenance cost in the long term. Eventually, the cloned variants need to be integrated into a configurable platform. Such an integration is challenging: it involves merging the usual code improvements between the variants, and also integrating the variable code (features) into the platform. Thus, variant integration differs from traditional soft- ware merging, which does not produce or organize configurable code, but creates a single system that cannot be configured into variants. In practice, variant integration requires fine-grained code edits, performed in an exploratory manner, in multiple iterations. Unfortunately, little tool support exists for integrating cloned variants. In this work, we show that fine-grained code edits needed for integration can be alleviated by a small set of integration intentions-domain-specific actions declared over code snippets controlling the integration. Developers can interactively explore the integration space by declaring (or revoking) intentions on code elements. We contribute the intentions (e.g., \'keep functionality\' or \'keep as a configurable feature\') and the IDE tool INCLINE, which implements the intentions and five editable views that visualize the integration process and allow declaring intentions producing a configurable integrated platform. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the completeness of the pro- posed intentions, the correctness and performance of INCLINE, and the benefits of using intentions for variant integration.

We describe an approach to identify rotten green tests by combining simple static and dynamic call-site analyses.

Existing work suffers from an unresolved paradox - a highly precise analysis limits its scalability and an imprecise one seriously hurts its precision or recall. In this work, we present SMOKE, a staged approach to resolve this paradox. In the first stage, instead of using a uniform precise analysis for all paths, we use a scalable but imprecise analysis to compute a succinct set of candidate memory leak paths. In the second stage, we leverage a more precise analysis to verify the feasibility of those candidates. The first stage is scalable, due to the design of a new sparse program representation, the use-flow graph (UFG), that models the problem as a polynomial-time state analysis. The second stage analysis is both precise and efficient, due to the smaller number of candidates and the design of a dedicated constraint solver. Experimental results show that SMOKE can finish checking industrial-sized projects, up to 8MLoC, in forty minutes with an average false positive rate of 24.4%. Besides, SMOKE is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art research techniques as well as the industrial tools, with the speedup ranging from 5.2X to 22.8X.

Crowdsourced workers typically perform testing tasks and report their experiences through test reports. While the crowdsourced test reports provide feedbacks from real usage scenarios, inspecting such a large number of reports becomes a time-consuming yet inevitable task. To improve the efficiency of this task, existing widely used issue-tracking systems, such as JIRA, Bugzilla, and Mantis, have provided keyword-search-based methods to assist users in identifying duplicate test reports. However, on mobile devices (such as mobile phones), where the crowdsourced test reports often contain insufficient text descriptions but instead rich screenshots, these text-analysis-based methods become less effective because the data has fundamentally changed. In this paper, instead of focusing on only detecting duplicates based on textual descriptions, we present CTRAS: a novel approach to leveraging duplicates to enrich the content of bug descriptions and improve the efficiency of inspecting these reports. CTRAS is capable of automatically aggregating duplicates based on both textual information and screenshots, and further summarizes the duplicate test reports into a comprehensive and comprehensible report.

Given a buggy program that fails some test cases, a typical automatic repair technique tries to modify the program to make all tests pass. However, since the test suites in real world projects are usually insufficient, aiming at passing the test suites often leads to incorrect patches. This problem is known as weak test suites or overfitting. In this paper we aim to produce precise patches, that is, any patch we produce has a relatively high probability to be correct. More concretely, we focus on condition synthesis, which was shown to be able to repair more than half of the defects in existing approaches. Our key insight is threefold. First, it is important to know what variables in a local context should be used in an \"if\" condition, and we propose a sorting method based on the dependency relations between variables. Second, we observe that the API document can be used to guide the repair process, and propose document analysis technique to further filter the variables. Third, it is important to know what predicates should be performed on the set of variables, and we propose to mine a set of frequently used predicates in similar contexts from existing projects. Based on the insight, we develop a novel program repair system, ACS, that could generate precise conditions at faulty locations. Furthermore, given the generated conditions are very precise, we can perform a repair operation that is previously deemed to be too overfitting: directly returning the test oracle to repair the defect.

Therefore, we propose to model such uncertainty using probabilities and propose a novel disassembly technique, which computes a probability for each address in the code space, indicating its likelihood of being a true positive instruction.

Given multiple answers to a certain question, developers may take the accepted answer, the answer from a person with high reputation, or the one frequently suggested. However, researchers recently observed that SO contains exploitable security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of popular answers, which found their way into security-sensitive high-profile applications that millions of users install every day. This observation inspires us to explore the following questions: How much can we trust the security implementation suggestions on SO? If suggested answers are vulnerable, can developers rely on the community\'s dynamics to infer the vulnerability and identify a secure counterpart? To answer these highly important questions, we conducted a comprehensive study on security-related SO posts by contrasting secure and insecure advice with the community-given content evaluation. Thereby, we investigated whether SO\'s gamification approach on incentivizing users is effective in improving security properties of distributed code examples. Moreover, we traced the distribution of duplicated samples over given answers to test whether the community behavior facilitates or prevents propagation of secure and insecure code suggestions within SO. We compiled 953 different groups of similar security-related code examples and labeled their security, identifying 785 secure answer posts and 644 insecure answer posts.

This problem is exacerbated by environmental failures that distract from product faults. In this paper we present techniques with the goal of capturing the maximum number of product faults, while flagging the minimum number of log lines for inspection. We observe that the location of a fault in a log should be contained in the lines of a failing test log. In contrast, a passing test log should not contain the lines related to a failure. Lines that occur in both a passing and failing log introduce noise when attempting to find the fault in a failing log. We introduce an approach where we remove the lines that occur in the passing log from the failing log. After removing these lines, we use information retrieval techniques to flag the most probable lines for investigation. We modify TF-IDF to identify the most relevant log lines related to past product failures.

In this work, we propose a feedback-based debugging approach, which (1) builds on light-weight human feedbacks on a buggy program and (2) regards the feedbacks as partial program specification to infer suspicious steps of the buggy execution. Given a buggy program, we record its execution trace and allow developers to provide light-weight feedback on trace steps. Based on the feedbacks, we recommend suspicious steps on the trace.

Unfortunately developers often lack knowledge of what kinds of designs and architectures can help address software energy consumption. In this paper we show that some simple design choices can have significant effects on energy consumption. In particular we examine the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and demonstrate how converting to Model-View-Presenter with bundling can improve the energy performance of both benchmark systems and real world applications. We show the relationship between energy consumption and bundled and delayed view updates: bundling events in the presenter can often reduce energy consumption by 30%.',0,'software energy consumption, MVP, MVC, software architecture',80,'Energy consumption;Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Unified modeling language;Observers;Software;Mobile handsets,energy consumption;mobile computing;power aware computing;software architecture;software maintenance,energy impact;software energy consumption;energy performance;model-view-presenter;model-view-controller architectural pattern','GreenBundle: An Empirical Study on the Energy Impact of Bundled Processing'),(1631,'Lambda expressions have been introduced in Java 8 to support functional programming and enable behavior parameterization by passing functions as parameters to methods.

However, the absence of explicit support for architectural constructs, such as software components, in the programming language itself has prevented software developers from achieving the many benefits that come with architecture-based development. To address this issue, Java 9 has introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), resulting in the first instance of encapsulation of modules with rich software architectural interfaces added to a mainstream programming language. The primary goal of JPMS is to construct and maintain large applications efficiently-as well as improve the encapsulation, security, and maintainability of Java applications in general and the JDK itself. A challenge, however, is that module declarations do not necessarily reflect actual usage of modules in an application, allowing developers to mistakenly specify inconsistent dependencies among the modules. In this paper, we formally define 8 inconsistent modular dependencies that may arise in Java-9 applications. We also present DARCY, an approach that leverages these definitions and static program analyses to automatically (1) detect the specified inconsistent dependencies within Java applications and (2) repair those identified inconsistencies.

On the basis of the familial trait of Android malware observed by previous work, the familial analysis is a promising way to help analysts better focus on the commonalities of malware samples within the same families, thus reducing the analytical workload and accelerating malware analysis. The majority of existing approaches rely on supervised learning and face three main challenges, i.e., low accuracy, low efficiency, and the lack of labeled dataset. To address these challenges, we first construct a fine-grained behavior model by abstracting the program semantics into a set of subgraphs. Then, we propose SRA, a novel feature that depicts the similarity relationships between the Structural Roles of sensitive API call nodes in subgraphs. An SRA is obtained based on graph embedding techniques and represented as a vector, thus we can effectively reduce the high complexity of graph matching. After that, instead of training a classifier with labeled samples, we construct malware link network based on SRAs and apply community detection algorithms on it to group the unlabeled samples into groups. We implement these ideas in a system called GefDroid that performs Graph embedding based familial analysis of AnDroid malware using unsupervised learning. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate GefDroid on three datasets with ground truth. The results show that GefDroid can achieve high agreements (0.707-0.883 in term of NMI) between the clustering results and the ground truth.

Once discovered, vulnerabilities are often fixed by applying security patches. In that sense, security patches carry valuable information about vulnerabilities, which could be used to discover, understand and fix (similar) vulnerabilities. However, most existing patch analysis approaches work at the source code level, while binary-level patch analysis often heavily relies on a lot of human efforts and expertise. Even worse, some vulnerabilities may be secretly patched without applying CVE numbers, or only the patched binary programs are available while the patches are not publicly released. These practices greatly hinder patch analysis and vulnerability analysis. In this paper, we propose a scalable binary-level patch analysis framework, named SPAIN, which can automatically identify security patches and summarize patch patterns and their corresponding vulnerability patterns. Specifically, given the original and patched versions of a binary program, we locate the patched functions and identify the changed traces (i.e., a sequence of basic blocks) that may contain security or non-security patches. Then we identify security patches through a semantic analysis of these traces and summarize the patterns through a taint analysis on the patched functions. The summarized patterns can be used to search similar patches or vulnerabilities in binary programs. Our experimental results on several real-world projects have shown that: i) SPAIN identified security patches with high accuracy and high scalability, ii) SPAIN summarized 5 patch patterns and their corresponding vulnerability patterns for 5 vulnerability types, and iii) SPAIN discovered security patches that were not documented, and discovered 3 zero-day vulnerabilities.',9,'',44,'Security;Semantics;Software;Tools;Scalability;Registers;Portable document format,security of data;software engineering,SPAIN;security patch analysis;software vulnerability;software security;scalable binary-level patch analysis framework;binary programs','SPAIN: Security Patch Analysis for Binaries towards Understanding the Pain and Pills'),(1679,'In recent years, coverage-based greybox fuzzing has proven itself to be one of the most effective techniques for finding security bugs in practice. Particularly, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL for short) is deemed to be a great success in fuzzing relatively simple test inputs. Unfortunately, when it meets structured test inputs such as XML and JavaScript, those grammar-blind trimming and mutation strategies in AFL hinder the effectiveness and efficiency. To this end, we propose a grammar-aware coverage-based greybox fuzzing approach to fuzz programs that process structured inputs. Given the grammar (which is often publicly available) of test inputs, we introduce a grammar-aware trimming strategy to trim test inputs at the tree level using the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of parsed test inputs. Further, we introduce two grammar-aware mutation strategies (i.e., enhanced dictionary-based mutation and tree-based mutation). Specifically, tree-based mutation works via replacing subtrees using the ASTs of parsed test inputs. Equipped with grammar-awareness, our approach can carry the fuzzing exploration into width and depth. We implemented our approach as an extension to AFL, named Superion; and evaluated the effectiveness of Superion using large- scale programs (i.e., an XML engine libplist and three JavaScript engines WebKit, Jerryscript and ChakraCore).

Model checking is considered to be one of the effective methods for exhausting behavioural state space for correctness. However, existing modelling approaches for interrupt-driven systems are based on either calculus or automata theory, and have a steep learning curve.

Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are suitable models to analyze time-bounded performance metrics (e.g., how likely a performance degradation may occur within some future period). One challenge to harness CTMCs is the measurement of model parameters (i.e., transition rates) in CTMCs at runtime. As these parameters may be updated by the system or environment frequently, it is difficult for the model builder to provide precise parameter values.

Our research goal is to help analysts measure the gaps between security policies and reported breaches by developing a systematic process based on semantic reasoning. We propose SEMAVER, a framework for determining coverage of breaches by policies via comparison of individual policy clauses and breach descriptions. We represent a security policy as a set of norms. Norms (commitments, authorizations, and prohibitions) describe expected behaviors of users, and formalize who is accountable to whom and for what. A breach corresponds to a norm violation.

The key idea is to exploit natural language information in source code, such as comments, function names, and parameter names, a rich source of knowledge that is typically ignored by type inference algorithms. We formulate the problem of predicting types as a classification problem and train a recurrent, LSTM-based neural model that, after learning from an annotated code base, predicts function types for unannotated code.

Moreover, on top of the formal semantics, we devise a lightweight type system that can detect bugs due to the unintuitive inter-language communication. We show that it detects more bugs more efficiently than HybriDroid, the state-of-the-art analyzer of Android hybrid apps, in real-world Android hybrid apps.',1,'Android hybrid applications, interoperability, multi-language systems, operational semantics, type system',25,'Java;Semantics;Interoperability;Bridges;Computer bugs;Switches;Cognition,Android (operating system);formal specification;Java;mobile computing;open systems,Android interoperations;device-specific features;Android Java;formal specification;Android interoperability;Android source code;dynamic interoperability;formal interoperation semantics;real-world Android hybrid apps;multilanguage semantics','Towards Understanding and Reasoning About Android Interoperations'),(1845,'(Good) Software documentation provides developers and users with a description of what a software system does, how it operates, and how it should be used. For example, technical documentation (e.g., an API reference guide) aids developers during evolution/maintenance activities, while a user manual explains how users are to interact with a system. Despite its intrinsic value, the creation and the maintenance of documentation is often neglected, negatively impacting its quality and usefulness, ultimately leading to a generally unfavourable take on documentation. Previous studies investigating documentation issues have been based on surveying developers, which naturally leads to a somewhat biased view of problems affecting documentation. We present a large scale empirical study, where we mined, analyzed, and categorized 878 documentation-related artifacts stemming from four different sources, namely mailing lists, Stack Overflow discussions, issue repositories, and pull requests.

This, however, may cause ASR tools to generate repairs that are incorrect and hard to generalize. To assess patch correctness, researchers have been following two methods separately: (1) Automated annotation, wherein patches are automatically labeled by an independent test suite (ITS) - a patch passing the ITS is regarded as correct or generalizable, and incorrect otherwise, (2) Author annotation, wherein authors of ASR techniques manually annotate the correctness labels of patches generated by their and competing tools. While automated annotation cannot ascertain that a patch is actually correct, author annotation is prone to subjectivity. This concern has caused an on-going debate on the appropriate ways to assess the effectiveness of numerous ASR techniques proposed recently. In this work, we propose to assess reliability of author and automated annotations on patch correctness assessment. We do this by first constructing a gold set of correctness labels for 189 randomly selected patches generated by 8 state-of-the-art ASR techniques through a user study involving 35 professional developers as independent annotators. By measuring inter-rater agreement as a proxy for annotation quality - as commonly done in the literature - we demonstrate that our constructed gold set is on par with other high-quality gold sets. We then compare labels generated by author and automated annotations with this gold set to assess reliability of the patch assessment methodologies.

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence about the uptake of this advice. Our goal is to understand the usage of immutability by C++ developers in practice. This work investigates how C++ developers use immutability by analyzing their use of the C++ immutability qualifier, const, and by analyzing the code itself. We answer the following broad questions about const usage: 1) do developers actually write non-trivial (more than 3 methods) immutable classes and immutable methods? 2) do developers label their immutable classes and methods? We analyzed 7 medium-to-large open source projects and collected two sources of empirical data: 1) const annotations by developers, indicating an intent to write immutable code; and 2) the results of a simple static analysis which identified easily const-able methods---those that clearly did not mutate state. We estimate that 5% of non-trivial classes (median) are immutable. We found the vast majority of classes do carry immutability labels on methods: surprisingly, developers const-annotate 46% of methods, and we estimate that at least 51% of methods could be const-annotated. Furthermore, developers missed immutability labels on at least 6% of unannotated methods.

Waste is any activity that produces no value for the customer or user. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe different types of waste in software development. Method: Following Constructivist Grounded Theory, we conducted a two-year five-month participant-observation study of eight software development projects at Pivotal, a software development consultancy. We also interviewed 33 software engineers, interaction designers, and product managers, and analyzed one year of retrospection topics. We iterated between analysis and theoretical sampling until achieving theoretical saturation. Results: This paper introduces the first empirical waste taxonomy. It identifies nine wastes and explores their causes, underlying tensions, and overall relationship to the waste taxonomy found in Lean Software Development. Limitations: Grounded Theory does not support statistical generalization. While the proposed taxonomy appears widely applicable, organizations with different software development cultures may experience different waste types.

Redundant operations are a common performance limiter in these code bases. Missed compiler optimization opportunities, inappropriate data structure and algorithm choices, and developers\' inattention to performance are some common reasons for the existence of redundant operations. Developers mainly depend on compilers to eliminate redundant operations. However, compilers\' static analysis often misses optimization opportunities due to ambiguities and limited analysis scope; automatic optimizations to algorithmic and data structural problems are out of scope. We develop LoadSpy, a whole-program profiler to pinpoint redundant memory load operations, which are often a symptom of many redundant operations. The strength of LoadSpy exists in identifying and quantifying redundant load operations in programs and associating the redundancies with program execution contexts and scopes to focus developers\' attention on problematic code. LoadSpy works on fully optimized binaries, adopts various optimization techniques to reduce its overhead, and provides a rich graphic user interface, which make it a complete developer tool. Applying LoadSpy showed that a large fraction of redundant loads is common in modern software packages despite highest levels of automatic compiler optimizations.

Hence, it is crucial for it to be correct and efficient, both of which are difficult to ensure. On one hand, accumulated rounding errors in numerical programs can cause system failures. On the other hand, arbitrary/infinite-precision arithmetic, although accurate, is infeasible in practice and especially in resource-limited scenarios because it performs thousands of times slower than floating-point arithmetic. Thus, it has been a significant challenge to obtain high-precision, easy-to-maintain, and efficient numerical code. This paper introduces a novel global optimization framework to tackle this challenge. Using our framework, a developer simply writes the infinite-precision numerical program directly following the problem\'s mathematical requirement specification. The resulting code is correct and easy-to-maintain, but inefficient. Our framework then optimizes the program in a global fashion (i.e., considering the whole program, rather than individual expressions or statements as in prior work), the key technical difficulty this work solves. To this end, it analyzes the program\'s numerical value flows across different statements through a symbolic trace extraction algorithm, and generates optimized traces via stochastic algebraic transformations guided by effective rule selection. We first evaluate our technique on numerical benchmarks from the literature; results show that our global optimization achieves significantly higher worst-case accuracy than the state-of-the-art numerical optimization tool. Second, we show that our framework is also effective on benchmarks having complicated program structures, which are challenging for numerical optimization.

However, showing ads on websites comes with a price tag. Since website contents and third-party ads are blended together, third-party ads may compete with the publisher contents, delaying or even breaking the rendering of first-party contents. In addition, dynamically including scripts from ad networks all over the world may introduce buggy scripts that slow down page loads and even freeze the browser. The resulting poor usability problems lead to bad user experience and lower profits. The problems caused by such resource abusing ads are originated from two root causes: First, content publishers have no control over third-party ads. Second, publishers cannot differentiate resource consumed by ads from that consumed by their own contents. To address these challenges, we propose an effective technique, AdJust, that allows publishers to specify constraints on events associated with third-party ads (e.g., URL requests, HTML element creations, and timers), so that they can mitigate user experience degradations and enforce consistent ads experience to all users. We report on a series of experiments over the Alexa top 200 news websites.

In this work, we present a novel APR technique that generalizes single-hunk repair techniques to include an important class of multi-hunk bugs, namely bugs that may require applying a substantially similar patch at a number of locations. We term such sets of repair locations as evolutionary siblings - similar looking code, instantiated in similar contexts, that are expected to undergo similar changes. At the heart of our proposed method is an analysis to accurately identify a set of evolutionary siblings, for a given bug. This analysis leverages three distinct sources of information, namely the test-suite spectrum, a novel code similarity analysis, and the revision history of the project. The discovered siblings are then simultaneously repaired in a similar fashion.

However, there is no consensus on which type of representation better supports the comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey\'s cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies performed in two countries with 69 and 83 participants respectively, in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models. Conclusions: Our findings can be explained by Vessey\'s cognitive fit theory as tabular models implicitly capture elementary linear spatial relationships. Interest for ICSE: It is almost taken for granted in Software Engineering that graphical-, diagram-based models are \"the\" way to go (e.g., the SE Body of Knowledge).

Firstly, there are potentially two different standardized mean difference effect sizes that can be calculated, depending on whether the mean difference is standardized by the pooled within groups variance or the within-participants variance. Hence, we provided equations for non-standardized and standardized effect sizes and explained the need for two different types of standardized effect size, one for the repeated measures and one that would be equivalent to an independent groups design. Secondly, as for any estimated parameters and also for the purposes of undertaking meta-analysis, it is necessary to calculate the variance of the standardized mean difference effect sizes (which is not the same as the variance of the study). Hence, we provided formulas for the small sample size effect size variance and the medium sample size approximation to the effect size variance, for both types of standardized effect size. We also presented the model underlying the AB/BA crossover design and provided two examples (an empirical analysis of the real data set by Scanniello, as well as simulated data) to demonstrate how to construct the two standardized mean difference effect sizes and their variances, both from standard descriptive statistics and from the outputs provided by the linear mixed model package lme4 in R. A conclusion is that crossover designs should be considered (instead of between groups design) only if: · previous research has suggested that ρ is greater than zero and preferably greater than 0.25; · there is either strong theoretical argument, or empirical evidence from a well-powered study, that the period by technique interaction is negligible.

(2) Presents the formulas needed to estimate the variances of the non-standardized and standardized effect sizes which in the later cases need to be appropriate for the small to medium sample sizes commonly used in software engineering crossover designs (see Section 5 of our paper [3]). (3) Explains how to calculate the effect sizes and their variances both from the descriptive statistics that should be reported and from the raw data (see Section 6 of our paper [3]). It is worth mentioning that we based our formulas on our own corrections to the formulas presented earlier by Curtin et al. [1]. Our corrections for the variances of standardized weighted mean difference of an AB/BA cross-over trial were accepted by the author of the original formulas (Curtin), submitted jointly as a letter to Editor of Statistics in Medicine to assure the widespread (also beyond the software engineering domain) adoption of the corrected formulas, and accepted [2]. We proposed an alternative formulation of the standardized effect size for individual difference effects that is comparable with the standardized effect size commonly used for pretest/posttest studies. We also corrected the small sample size and moderate sample size variances reported by Curtin et al. for both the individual difference effect size and the standardized effect size comparable to independent groups trials, showing the derivation of the formulas from the variance of at-variable. Using these results, researchers can now correctly calculate standardized effect size variances, allowing the calculation of confidence intervals for AB/BA cross-over trials, which in turn provides a direct link to null hypothesis testing and supports meta-analysis. Meta-analysts can now validly aggregate together results from independent groups, pretest/posttest and AB/BA cross-over trials. Last but not least, the presented contributions allow corrections of previously reported results.',0,'Empirical software engineering;Meta-analysis;Effect size',0,'Software engineering;Size measurement;Analytical models;Data models;Standards;Clinical trials;Computer science,medical computing;software engineering;statistical analysis,standardized mean difference effect sizes;standardized weighted mean difference;sample size effect size variance;medium sample size approximation;difference effect size;AB-BA crossover design;software engineering literature;meta-analysis;standard descriptive statistics;linear mixed model package;null hypothesis testing;posttest studies;pretest studies;software engineering crossover designs','[Journal First] Effect Sizes and their Variance for AB/BA Crossover Design Studies'),(3021,'Numerous automated techniques have been proposed to reduce the cost of software debugging, a notoriously time-consuming and human-intensive activity. Among these techniques, Statistical Fault Localization (SFL) is particularly popular. One issue with SFL is that it is based on strong, often unrealistic assumptions on how developers behave when debugging. To address this problem, we propose Enlighten, an interactive, feedback-driven fault localization technique. Given a failing test, Enlighten (1) leverages SFL and dynamic dependence analysis to identify suspicious method invocations and corresponding data values, (2) presents the developer with a query about the most suspicious invocation expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, (3) encodes the developer feedback on the correctness of individual data values as extra program specifications, and (4) repeats these steps until the fault is found. We evaluated Enlighten in two ways. First, we applied Enlighten to 1,807 real and seeded faults in 3 open source programs using an automated oracle as a simulated user; for over 96% of these faults, Enlighten required less than 10 interactions with the simulated user to localize the fault, and a sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to erroneous responses. Second, we performed an actual user study on 4 faults with 24 participants and found that participants who used Enlighten performed significantly better than those not using our tool, in terms of both number of faults localized and time needed to localize the faults.',2,'debugging;fault localization;dynamic analysis',0,'Debugging;Performance analysis;Tools;Generators;Calculators;Software debugging;Task analysis,fault diagnosis;program debugging;program testing;software fault tolerance,enlightened debugging;numerous automated techniques;software debugging;notoriously time-consuming;human-intensive activity;unrealistic assumptions;feedback-driven fault localization technique;Enlighten leverages SFL;dynamic dependence analysis;developer feedback;individual data values;extra program specifications;automated oracle;sensitivity analysis;open source programs;statistical fault localization','Enlightened Debugging'),(3031,'Having great managers is as critical to success as having a good team or organization. A great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager. Through statistical analysis we identify how engineers and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering differs from other knowledge work groups.',0,'Manager;Software Engineering;Knowledge Work;Empirical Study;Conceptual Framework;Manager Attributes;Technical Skills',0,'Software;Software engineering;Birds;Productivity;Organizations;Tools;Knowledge engineering,DP management;project management;software development management;statistical analysis;team working,great manager;software engineers;good team;software engineering manager;software teams;manager attributes;software engineering research studies;statistical analysis;productivity','[Journal First] What Makes a Great Manager of Software Engineers?'),(3043,'The evolution of software systems is an inevitable process which has to be managed effectively to enhance software quality. Change impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that identifies impact sets, i.e., the set of classes that require correction as a result of a change made to a class or artefact. These sets can also be considered as ripple effects and typically non-local: changes propagate to different parts of a system. Two classes are considered logically coupled if they have co-changed in the past; past research has shown that the precision of CIA techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling (i.e., the extent to which the lexical content of two classes is related) are both considered. However, the relationship between semantic and logical coupling of software artefacts has not been extensively studied and no dependencies established between these two types of coupling. Are two often co-changed artefacts also strongly connected from a semantic point of view? Are two semantically similar artefacts bound to co-change in the future? Answering those questions would help increase the precision of CIA. It would also help software maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to co-evolve in the future. This study investigated the relationship between semantic and logical coupling. Using Chi-squared statistical tests, we identified similarities in semantic coupling using class corpora and class identifiers. We then computed Spearman\'s rank correlation between semantic and logical coupling metrics for class pairs to detect whether semantic and logical relationships co-varied in OO software. Finally, we investigated the overlap between semantic and logical relationships by identifying the proportion of classes linked through both coupling types. Our empirical study and results were based on seventy-nine open-source software projects. Results showed that: (a) measuring the semantic similarity of classes by using their identifiers is computationally efficient; (b) using identifier-based coupling can be used interchangeably with semantic similarity based on their corpora, albeit not always; (c) no correlation between the strengths of semantic and change coupling was found. Finally, (d) a directional relationship between the two was identified; 70% of semantic dependencies are linked through change coupling but not vice versa. Based on our findings, we conclude that identifying more efficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a directional relationship between semantic and change dependencies could help to improve CIA methods that integrate semantic coupling information. This may also help to reveal implicit dependencies not captured by static source code analysis.',0,'Semantic coupling;co-change;Java software;metrics',0,'Semantics;Couplings;Software;Computer science;Measurement;Software engineering;Correlation,object-oriented programming;software maintenance;software metrics;software quality;statistical analysis;statistical testing,directional relationship;semantic dependencies;semantic coupling computation;semantic coupling information;software classes;software systems;software quality;change impact analysis;CIA;software artefacts;semantically similar artefacts;software maintainers;class corpora;class identifiers;semantic coupling metrics;logical coupling metrics;semantic relationships;logical relationships;OO software;coupling types;open-source software projects;semantic similarity;identifier-based coupling','[Journal First] An Empirical Study on the Interplay Between Semantic Coupling and Co-change of Software Classes'),(3052,'This study presents MAHAKIL, a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach for software defect datasets that is based on the chromosomal theory of inheritance.

However, most research in this area originates from a time when programmers used a completely different tool chain. Objective: We examined the influence of syntax highlighting on novices\' ability to comprehend source code. Additional analyses cover the influence of task type and programming experience on the code comprehension ability itself and its relation to syntax highlighting. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment with 390 undergraduate students in an introductory Java programming course. We measured the correctness with which they solved small coding tasks. Each test subject received some tasks with syntax highlighting and some without. Results: The data provided no evidence that syntax highlighting improves novices\' ability to comprehend source code. Limitations: There are very few similar experiments and it is unclear as of yet which factors impact the effectiveness of syntax highlighting. One major limitation may be the types of tasks chosen for this experiment.

These tools have been shown to be effective in achieving good test coverage and in finding bugs without human intervention. Being automated, these tools typically run for a long time (say, for several hours), either until they saturate test coverage or until a testing time budget expires. Thus, these automated tools are not good at generating concise regression test suites that could be used for testing in incremental development of the apps and in regression testing. We propose a heuristic technique that helps create a small regression test suite for an Android app from a large test suite generated by an automated Android GUI testing tool. The key insight behind our technique is that if we can identify and remove some common forms of redundancies introduced by existing automated GUI testing tools, then we can drastically lower the time required to minimize a GUI test suite. We have implemented our algorithm in a prototype tool called DetReduce. We applied DetReduce to several Android apps and found that DetReduce reduces a test-suite by an average factor of16.9× in size and14.7× in running time. We also found that for a test suite generated by running SwiftHand and a randomized test generation algorithm for 8 hours, DetReduce minimizes the test suite in an average of 14.6 hours.',2,'Android;GUI;Test minimization',0,'Graphical user interfaces;Testing;Tools;Androids;Humanoid robots;Redundancy;Computer bugs,Android (operating system);graphical user interfaces;program testing,Android GUI test suites;randomized test generation algorithm;GUI test suite;testing tools;automated Android GUI testing tool;regression test suite;concise regression test suites;automated tools;testing time budget;Android app;automated GUI testing techniques;regression testing;DetReduce','DetReduce: Minimizing Android GUI Test Suites for Regression Testing'),(3084,'Whether software architects should also code is an enduring question. In order to satisfy performance, security, reliability and other quality concerns, architects need to compare and carefully choose a combination of architectural patterns, styles or tactics. Then later in the development cycle, these architectural choices must be implemented completely and correctly so there will not be any drift from envisioned design. In this paper, we use data analytics-based techniques to study five large-scale software systems, examining the impact and the role of software architects who write code on software quality. Our quantitative study is augmented with a follow-up interview of architects. This paper provides empirical evidence for supporting the pragmatic opinions that architects should write code.

Different properties of these environments such as web-browser types and underlying platforms may cause a web application to exhibit different types of failures. As web applications evolve, they must be regression tested across these different environments. Because there are many environments to consider this process can be expensive, resulting in delayed feedback about failures in applications. In this work, we propose six techniques for providing a developer with faster feedback on failures when regression testing web applications across different web-browser environments. Our techniques draw on methods used in test case prioritization; however, in our case we prioritize web-browser environments, based on information on recent and frequent failures.

Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple\'s App Store provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and most recently in the Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work) incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to an app. In this paper [1], we revisit our prior finding in more depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses of 2,328 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1) developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their content, 3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses of the top ten apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue between users and developers provides valuable insights that can lead to improvements in the app store and the user support process. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Our paper is the first work to demonstrate the dynamic nature of reviews.

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties.

Inspired by bioinformatics, motifs are patterns in traces that are flexible to small changes in execution, and are captured in a hierarchical model. The hierarchical nature of the model provides an overview of the behaviour at a high-level, while preserving the execution details and intermediate levels in a structured manner.

Such decisions are taken with varying degrees of expertise in security. In some organisations - particularly those with resources - these are the preserve of computer (or information) security teams. In others - typically smaller organisations - the computing services team may be charged with the responsibility. Often managers have a role to play as guardians of business targets and goals. Be it common workplace practices or strategic decision making, security decisions underpin not only the initial security requirements and their prioritisation but also the adaptation and evolution of these requirements as new business or security contexts arise. However, little is currently understood about how these various demographics approach cyber security decisions and the strategies and approaches that underpin those decisions. What are the typical decision patterns, if any, the consequences of such patterns and their impact (positive or negative) on the security of the system in question? Nor is there any substantial understanding of how the strategies and decision patterns of these different groups contrast. Is security expertise necessarily an advantage when making security decisions in a given context? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the \"how\" and \"why\" behind security decision processes. The Game: In this talk [1], we present a tabletop game - Decisions and Disruptions (D-D) [2] - as a means to investigate these very questions. The game tasks a group of players with managing the security of a small utility company while facing a variety of threats. The game provides a requirements sandbox in which players can experiment with threats, learn about decision making and its consequences, and reflect on their own perception of risk. The game is intentionally kept short - 2 hours - and simple enough to be played without prior training. A cyber-physical infrastructure, depicted through a Lego(R) board, makes the game easy to understand and accessible to players from varying backgrounds and security expertise, without being too trivial a setting for security experts. Key insights: We played D-D with 43 players divided into homogeneous groups (group sizes of 2-6 players): 4 groups of security experts, 4 groups of non-technical managers and 4 groups of general computer scientists. Such observations should, of course, not be generalised, however, the substantial sample size enables in-depth qualitative analysis. Our analysis reveals a number of novel insights regarding security decisions of our three demographics: - Strategies: Security experts had a strong interest in advanced technological solutions and tended to neglect intelligence gathering, to their own detriment: some security expert teams achieved poor results in the game. Managers, too, were technology-driven and focused on data protection while neglecting human factors more than other groups. Computer scientists tended to balance human factors and intelligence gathering with technical solutions, and achieved the best results of the three demographics. - Decision Processes: Technical experience significantly changes the way players think. Teams with little technical experience had shallow, intuition-driven discussions with few concrete arguments. Technical teams, and the most experienced in particular, had much richer debates, driven by concrete scenarios, anecdotes from experience, and procedural thinking. Security experts showed a high confidence in their decisions - despite some of them having bad consequences - while the other groups tended to doubt their own skills - even when they were playing good games. - Patterns: A number of characteristic plays could be identified, some good (balance between priorities, open-mindedness, and adapting strategies based on inputs that challenge one\'s pre-conceptions), some bad (excessive focus on particular issues, confidence in charismatic leaders), some ugly (\"tunnel vision\" syndrome by over-confident players). These patterns are documented and discussed in the full paper - showing the virtue of the positive ones, discouraging the negative ones, and inviting the readers to do their own introspection. Conclusion: D-D complements existing work on gamification as a means to improve security awareness, education, and training. Beyond the analysis of the security decisions of the three demographics, there is a definite educational and awareness-raising aspect to D-D (as noted consistently by players in all our subject groups).

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic.

Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time.',9,'Test selection;Regression testing;Dynamic analysis;Empirical study',0,'Testing;Tools;Java;Runtime;Open source software,program testing;regression analysis,hybrid RTS approach;granularity RTS;selected test ratio;offline testing time;method-level changes;instance method additions/deletions;file-level changes;online testing time;code changes;RTS techniques;hybrid regression test selection;regression testing cost reduction;HyRTS technique;FRTS','Hybrid Regression Test Selection'),(3207,'This research investigates how object-oriented inheritance is actually used in practice.

The findings show that inheritance is very widely used but that most of the usage patterns that occur in practice are simple in structure. They are so simple that they may not require much inheritance-specific design consideration. On the other hand, the majority of classes defined using inheritance actually appear within a relatively small number of large, complex hierarchies. While some of these large hierarchies appear to have a consistent structure, often based on a problem domain model or a design pattern, others do not. Another contribution is that the quality of hierarchies, especially the large problematic ones, may be assessed in practice based on size, shape, and the definition and invocation of novel methods - all properties that can be detected automatically.',0,'Object-oriented;inheritance;open source;empirical;design guidance',0,'Software engineering;Gold,inheritance;object-oriented methods;public domain software,inheritance hierarchies;complex hierarchies;inheritance-specific design consideration;inheritance hierarchy design quality;14 open-source systems;inheritance guidance;object-oriented inheritance;inheritance usage patterns','Inheritance Usage Patterns in Open-Source Systems'),(3214,'Over the past 25 years, thousands of developers have contributed more than 18 million lines of code (LOC) to the Linux kernel. As the Linux kernel forms the central part of various operating systems that are used by millions of users, the kernel must be continuously adapted to the changing demands and expectations of these users. The Linux kernel provides its services to an application through system calls. The combined set of all system calls forms the essential Application Programming Interface (API) through which an application interacts with the kernel. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 8,770 changes that were made to Linux system calls during the last decade (i.e., from April 2005 to December 2014). In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls).

Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others\' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic. Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE. Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques. Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.',0,'Collaborative MDSE;CoMDSE;C MDSE;model driven engineering;collaborative software engineering;CoSE;systematic mapping study',0,'Software engineering;Analytical models;Unified modeling language;Stakeholders;Collaborative software;Tools,decision making;groupware;software engineering;software maintenance;Unified Modeling Language,collaborative model-driven software engineering;CoSE;UML-based approach;decision making;understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches;model-driven engineering','Collaborative Model-Driven Software Engineering: A Classification Framework and a Research Map [Extended Abstract]'),(3249,'Just-In-Time (JIT) models identify fix-inducing code changes. JIT models are trained using techniques that assume that past fix-inducing changes are similar to future ones. However, this assumption may not hold, e.g., as system complexity tends to accrue, expertise may become more important as systems age. In this paper, we study JIT models as systems evolve. Through a longitudinal case study of 37,524 changes from the rapidly evolving Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that fluctuations in the properties of fix-inducing changes can impact the performance and interpretation of JIT models. More specifically: (a) the discriminatory power (AUC) and calibration (Brier) scores of JIT models drop considerably one year after being trained; (b) the role that code change properties (e.g., Size, Experience) play within JIT models fluctuates over time; and (c) those fluctuations yield over- and underestimates of the future impact of code change properties on the likelihood of inducing fixes. To avoid erroneous or misleading predictions, JIT models should be retrained using recently recorded data (within three months). Moreover, quality improvement plans should be informed by JIT models that are trained using six months (or more) of historical data, since they are more resilient to period-specific fluctuations in the importance of code change properties.',1,'Just In Time prediction;Defect prediction;Mining software repositories',0,'Software engineering;Predictive models;History;Fluctuations;Training;Data models;Software,data mining;just-in-time;learning (artificial intelligence);public domain software;software fault tolerance;software management,fix-inducing changes;JIT models;just-in-time models;just-in-time defect prediction;Qt systems;OpenStack systems;fix-inducing code changes;code change properties','[Journal First] Are Fix-Inducing Changes a Moving Target?: A Longitudinal Case Study of Just-in-Time Defect Prediction'),(3254,'Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) specify how to access services and data over the network, typically using Web services. Web APIs are rapidly proliferating as a key element to foster reusability, integration, and innovation, enabling new consumption models such as mobile or smart TV apps. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, eBay or Netflix receive billions of API calls every day from thousands of different third-party applications and devices, which constitutes more than half of their total traffic. As Web APIs are progressively becoming the cornerstone of software integration, their validation is getting more critical. In this context, the fast detection of bugs is of utmost importance to increase the quality of internal products and third-party applications. However, testing Web APIs is challenging mainly due to the difficulty to assess whether the output of an API call is correct, i.e., the oracle problem. For instance, consider the Web API of the popular music streaming service Spotify. Suppose a search for albums with the query \"redhouse\" returning 21 total matches: Is this output correct? Do all the albums in the result set contain the keyword? Are there any albums containing the keyword not included in the result set? Answering these questions is difficult, even with small result sets, and often infeasible when the results are counted by thousands or millions. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by providing an alternative when the expected output of a test execution is complex or unknown. Rather than checking the output of an individual program execution, metamorphic testing checks whether multiple executions of the program under test fulfil certain necessary properties called metamorphic relations. For instance, consider the following metamorphic relation in Spotify: two searches for albums with the same query should return the same number of total results regardless of the size of pagination. Suppose that a new Spotify search is performed using the exact same query as before and increasing the maximum number of results per page from 20 (default value) to 50: This search returns 27 total albums (6 more matches than in the previous search), which reveals a bug. This is an example of a real and reproducible fault detected using the approach presented in this paper and reported to Spotify. According to Spotify developers, it was a regression fault caused by a fix with undesired side effects. In this paper [1], we present a metamorphic testing approach for the automated detection of faults in RESTful Web APIs (henceforth also referred to as simply Web APIs). We introduce the concept of metamorphic relation output patterns. A Metamorphic Relation Output Pattern (MROP) defines an abstract output relation typically identified in Web APIs, regardless of their application domain. Each MROP is defined in terms of set operations among test outputs such as equality, union, subset, or intersection. MROPs provide a helpful guide for the identification of metamorphic relations, broadening the scope of our work beyond a particular Web API. Based on the notion of MROP, a methodology is proposed for the application of the approach to any Web API following the REST architectural pattern. The approach was evaluated in several steps. First, we used the proposed methodology to identify 33 metamorphic relations in four Web APIs developed by undergraduate students. All the relations are instances of the proposed MROPs. Then, we assessed the effectiveness of the identified relations at revealing 317 automatically seeded faults (i.e., mutants) in the APIs under test. As a result, 302 seeded faults were detected, achieving a mutation score of 95.3%. Second, we evaluated the approach using real Web APIs and faults. In particular, we identified 20 metamorphic relations in the Web API of Spotify and 40 metamorphic relations in the Web API of YouTube. Each metamorphic relation was implemented and automatically executed using both random and manual test data. In total, 469K metamorphic tests were generated. As a result, 21 metamorphic relations were violated, and 11 issues revealed and reported (3 issues in Spotify and 8 issues in YouTube). To date, 10 of the reported issues have been either confirmed by the API developers or reproduced by other users supporting the effectiveness of our approach.',0,'Metamorphic testing;REST;RESTful Web services;Web API',0,'Testing;Software engineering;Software;Computer bugs;YouTube;Computer languages;Technological innovation,application program interfaces;program testing;Web services,metamorphic relation output pattern;RESTful Web API;MROP;metamorphic testing;REST architectural pattern','Metamorphic Testing of RESTful Web APIs'),(3265,'Debugging is an inevitable activity in most software projects, often difficult and more time-consuming than expected, giving it the nickname the \"dirty little secret of computer science.\" Surprisingly, we have little knowledge on how software engineers debug software problems in the real world, whether they use dedicated debugging tools, and how knowledgeable they are about debugging. This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as \"printf debugging\" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.',2,'Debugging;Testing;WatchDog;IntelliJ;Eclipse',0,'Debugging;Software;Tools;Instruments;Interviews;Computer bugs;Software engineering,computer debugging;program debugging;software engineering;software maintenance,integrated development environments;debugging experts;regular debugging users;printf debugging;advanced debugging features;software projects;software engineers debug software problems;debugging tools;mixed-methods research approach','On the Dichotomy of Debugging Behavior Among Programmers'),(3274,'The evidence-based software engineering approach advocates the use of evidence from empirical studies to support the decisions on the adoption of software technologies by practitioners in the software industry. To this end, many guidelines have been proposed to contribute to the execution and repeatability of literature reviews, and to the confidence of their results, especially regarding systematic literature reviews (SLR). To investigate similarities and differences, and to characterize the challenges and pitfalls of the planning and generated results of SLR research protocols dealing with the same research question and performed by similar teams of novice researchers in the context of the software engineering field. We qualitatively compared (using Jaccard and Kappa coefficients) and evaluated (using DARE) same goal SLR research protocols and outcomes undertaken by similar research teams. Seven similar SLR protocols regarding quality attributes for use cases executed in 2010 and 2012 enabled us to observe unexpected differences in their planning and execution. Even when the participants reached some agreement in the planning, the outcomes were different. The research protocols and reports allowed us to observe six challenges contributing to the divergences in the results: researchers\' inexperience in the topic, researchers\' inexperience in the method, lack of clearness and completeness of the papers, lack of a common terminology regarding the problem domain, lack of research verification procedures, and lack of commitment to the SLR. According to our findings, it is not possible to rely on results of SLRs performed by novices. Also, similarities at a starting or intermediate step during different SLR executions may not directly translate to the next steps, since non-explicit information might entail differences in the outcomes, hampering the repeatability and confidence of the SLR process and results. Although we do have expectations that the presence and follow-up of a senior researcher can contribute to increasing SLRs\' repeatability, this conclusion can only be drawn upon the existence of additional studies on this topic.

Developers are especially active on these Q&A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q&A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q&A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q&A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question\'s tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q&A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that (i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; (ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; (iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q&A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).',3,'Q&A website;Factor importance analysis;Response time',0,'Software engineering;Software;Knowledge engineering;Computer science;Logistics;Analytical models;Mathematics,human factors;question answering (information retrieval);regression analysis;software engineering;Web sites,technical questions;incentive systems;answer questions;rapid answering;Q&A website;fast answering;answerer dimension;accepted answer;question dimension;answer dimension;nonfrequent answerers;current incentive system motivates frequent answerers;answer short questions;question answering incentive system;stack exchange Websites;answer Websites','Understanding the Factors for Fast Answers in Technical Q&A Websites: An Empirical Study of Four Stack Exchange Websites'),(3288,'Effective program repair techniques, which modify faulty programs to fix them with respect to given test suites, can substantially reduce the cost of manual debugging. A common repair approach is to iteratively first generate candidate programs with possible bug fixes and then validate them against the given tests until a candidate that passes all the tests is found. While this approach is conceptually simple, due to the potentially high number of candidates that need to first be generated and then be compiled and tested, existing repair techniques that embody this approach have relatively low effectiveness, especially for faults at a fine granularity. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a novel repair technique, SketchFix, which generates candidate fixes on demand (as needed) during the test execution. Instead of iteratively re-compiling and re-executing each actual candidate program, SketchFix translates faulty programs to sketches, i.e., partial programs with \"holes\", and compiles each sketch once which may represent thousands of concrete candidates. With the insight that the space of candidates can be reduced substantially by utilizing the runtime behaviors of the tests, SketchFix lazily initializes the candidates of the sketches while validating them against the test execution. We experimentally evaluate SketchFix on the Defects4J benchmark and the experimental results show that SketchFix works particularly well in repairing bugs with expression manipulation at the AST node-level granularity compared to other program repair techniques. Specifically, SketchFix correctly fixes 19 out of 357 defects in 23 minutes on average using the default setting.

However, most verifiers do not understand conditions as input. In this paper, we propose the usage of an off-the-shelf construction of a conditional verifier from a given traditional verifier and a reducer. The reducer takes as input the program to be verified and the condition, and outputs a residual program whose paths cover the unverified state space described by the condition.

These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance. We then evaluate each approach in 2,135 queries extracted from three open source software and one industrial software system. Our results show that GA is able to completely cover 98.6% of all queries in the dataset, requiring only a few seconds per query.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps\' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features\' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications.

Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling--dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect.',2,'task links;change propagation;bugzilla;mylyn;empirical study',0,'Licenses,project management;software engineering;software maintenance,implicit dependencies;task links;extent change propagation;underlying task dependency;linked task pairs;nonlinked task pairs;software development efforts;explicit handling','Does the Propagation of Artifact Changes Across Tasks Reflect Work Dependencies?'),(3410,'Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints are typically used for providing precise semantics to models developed with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil&Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.',0,'Refactoring;Search;Object Constraint Language',0,'Cancer;Unified modeling language;Complexity theory;Couplings;Software engineering;Semantics;Measurement,evolutionary computation;object-oriented programming;search problems;software maintenance;Unified Modeling Language,cancer registries;automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach;OCL quality metrics;semantics-preserving refactoring operators;search algorithms;Cancer Registry;original OCL constraint;original constraint set;object constraint language constraints','Automated Refactoring of OCL Constraints with Search'),(3423,'Recent analyses[2, 4, 5] report that many sectors of our economy and society are more and more guided by data-driven decision processes (e.g., health care, public administrations, etc.). As such, Data Intensive (DI) applications are becoming more and more important and critical. They must be fault-tolerant, they should scale with the amount of data, and be able to elastically leverage additional resources as and when these last ones are provided [3]. Moreover, they should be able to avoid data drops introduced in case of sudden overloads and should offer some Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Ensuring all these properties is, per se, a challenge, but it becomes even more difficult for DI applications, given the large amount of data to be managed and the significant level of parallelism required for its components. Even if today some technological frameworks are available for the development of such applications (for instance, think of Spark, Storm, Flink), we still lack solid software engineering approaches to support their development and, in particular, to ensure that they offer the required properties in terms of availability, throughput, data loss, etc. In fact, at the time of writing, identifying the right solution can require several rounds of experiments and the adoption of many different technologies. This implies the need for highly skilled persons and the execution of experiments with large data sets and a large number of resources, and, consequently, a significant amount of time and budget. To experiment with currently available approaches, we performed an action research experiment focusing on developing- testing-reengineering a specific DI application, Hegira4Cloud, that migrates data between widely used NoSQL databases, including so-called Database as a Service (DaaS), as well as on-premise databases. This is a representative DI system because it has to handle large volumes of data with different structures and has to guarantee that some important characteristics, in terms of data types and transactional properties, are preserved. Also, it poses stringent requirements in terms of correctness, high performance, fault tolerance, and fast and effective recovery. In our action research, we discovered that the literature offered some high level design guidelines for DI applications, as well as some tools to support modelling and QoS analysis/simulation of complex architectures, however the available tools were not yet. suitable to support DI systems. Moreover, we realized that the available big data frameworks we could have used were not flexible enough to cope with all possible application-specific aspects of our system. Hence, to achieve the desired level of performance, fault tolerance and recovery, we had to adopt a time-consuming, experiment-based approach [1, 6], which, in our case, consisted of three iterations: (1) the design and implementation of a Mediation Data Model capable of managing data extracted from different databases, together with a first monholitical prototype of Hegira4Cloud; (2) the improvement of performance of our prototype when managing and transferring huge amounts of data; (3) the introduction of fault-tolerant data extraction and management mechanisms, which are independent from the targeted databases. Among the others, an important issue that has forced us to reiterate in the development of Hegira4Cloud concerned the DaaS we interfaced with. In particular these DaaS, which are well-known services with a large number of users: (1) were missing detailed information regarding the behaviour of their APIs; (2) did not offer a predictable service; (3) were suffering of random downtimes not correlated with the datasets we were experimenting with. In this journal first presentation, we describe our experience and the issues we encountered that led to some important decisions during the software design and engineering process.

With a few notable exceptions, empirical software engineering studies have exploited off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools. However, such tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. In particular, Jongeling et al. show how the choice of the sentiment analysis tool may impact the conclusion validity of empirical studies because not only these tools do not agree with human annotation of developers\' communication channels, but they also disagree among themselves. Our goal is to move beyond the limitations of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools when applied in the software engineering domain. Accordingly, we present Senti4SD, a sentiment polarity classifier for software developers\' communication channels. Senti4SD exploits a suite of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features for appropriately dealing with the domain-dependent use of a lexicon. We built a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) to derive the semantic features exploited by Senti4SD. Specifically, we ran word2vec on a collection of over 20 million documents from Stack Overflow, thus obtaining word vectors that are representative of developers\' communication style. The classifier is trained and validated using a gold standard of 4,423 Stack Overflow posts, including questions, answers, and comments, which were manually annotated for sentiment polarity. We release the full lab package, which includes both the gold standard and the emotion annotation guidelines, to ease the execution of replications as well as new studies on emotion awareness in software engineering. To inform future research on word embedding for text categorization and information retrieval in software engineering, the replication kit also includes the DSM. Results. The contribution of the lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features is assessed by our empirical evaluation leveraging different feature settings.

To date, however, the techniques considered have operated on test suites, and have not achieved substantial improvements. Moreover, they can be inappropriate to apply when system build costs are high. In this work we explore an alternative: prioritization of commits. We use a lightweight approach based on test suite failure and execution history that is highly efficient; our approach \"continuously\" prioritizes commits that are waiting for execution in response to the arrival of each new commit and the completion of each previously scheduled commit.

Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%).

Devy reduces the number of manual, often complex, low-level commands that developers need to perform, freeing them to focus on their high-level tasks.

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them.

SHB has not been studied per se - rather it has been reported on only as a byproduct of malware investigations. We address this gap via a study and suite of static analyses targeted at SH in Android apps. Specifically, we present (1) a detailed characterization of SHB, (2) a suite of static analyses to detect such behavior, and (3) a set of detectors that employ SHB to distinguish between benign and malicious apps. We show that SHB ranges from hiding the app\'s presence or activity to covering an app\'s traces, e.g., by blocking phone calls/text messages or removing calls and messages from logs.

We then matched and compared various subsets of these repositories on this TDD spectrum with control sets of equal size. The control sets were samples from all GitHub repositories that matched certain characteristics, and that contained at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets differed from the control sets on the following characteristics: number of test files, average commit velocity, number of bug-referencing commits, number of issues recorded, usage of continuous integration, number of pull requests, and distribution of commits per author.

In turn, consumers can influence the software development process by giving developers early feedback. This early access model has become increasingly popular through digital distribution platforms, such as Steam which is the most popular distribution platform for games. The plethora of options offered by Steam to communicate between developers and game players contribute to the popularity of the early access model. The early access model made a name for itself through several successful games, such as the DayZ game. The multiplayer survival-based game reached 400,000 sales during its first week as an early access game. However, the benefits of the early access model have been questioned as well. For instance, the Spacebase DF-9 game abandoned the early access stage unexpectedly, disappointing many players of the game. Shortly after abandoning the early access stage and terminating the development, twelve employees were laid off including the programmer and project lead. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 1,182 Early Access Games (EAGs) on the Steam platform to understand the characteristics, advantages and limitations of the early access model. We find that 15% of the games on Steam make use of the early access model, with the most popular EAG having as many as 29 million owners. 88% of the EAGs are classified by their developers as so-called \"indie\" games, indicating that most EAGs are developed by individual developers or small studios. We study the interaction between players and developers of EAGs and the Steam platform. We observe that on the one hand, developers update their games more frequently in the early access stage. On the other hand, the percentage of players that review a game during its early access stage is lower than the percentage of players that review the game after it leaves the early access stage. However, the average rating of the reviews is much higher during the early access stage, suggesting that players are more tolerant of imperfections in the early access stage. The positive review rate does not correlate with the length or the game update frequency of the early access stage. In addition, we discuss several learned lessons from the failure of an early access game. The main learned lesson from this failure is that the communication between the game developer and the players of the EAG is crucial. Players enjoy getting involved in the development of an early access game and they get emotionally involved in the decision-making about the game. Based on our findings, we suggest game developers to use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, our findings suggest that developers can determine their release schedule without worrying about the length of the early access stage and the game update frequency during the early access stage.',0,'early access games;computer games;Steam',0,'Games;Software;Software engineering;Decision making;Schedules;Lead;Computational modeling,computer games;sales management;software engineering,game developer;game players;Steam platform;software development process;consumers;digital distribution platforms;DayZ game;multiplayer survival-based game;Spacebase DF-9 game;employees;programmer;project lead;decision-making;EAG;early access stage;early access game;early access model','[Journal First] An Empirical Study of Early Access Games on the Steam Platform'),(3567,'Software systems are increasingly expected to cope with variable workloads, component failures and other uncertainties through self-adaptation.

Still, all approaches we are aware of require a manual assessment of familiarity and empirical analyses of forgetting in software development are missing. In this paper, we address this issue with an empirical study that we conducted with 60 open-source developers.

Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance anti-patterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them.

Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes).

These performance tests often consume large amounts of computing resources and time since heavy loads need to be generated. Making it worse, the ever evolving eld requires frequent updates to the performance testing environment. In practice, virtual machines (VMs) are widely exploited to provide exible and less costly environments for performance tests. However, the use of VMs may introduce confounding overhead (e.g., a higher than expected memory utilization with unstable I/O tra c) to the testing environment and lead to unre-alistic performance testing results. Yet, little research has studied the impact on test results of using VMs in performance testing activities. To evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing results from virtual and physical environments, we perform a case study on two open source systems - namely Dell DVD Store (DS2) and CloudStore. We conduct the same performance tests in both virtual and physical environments and compare the performance testing results based on the three aspects that are typically examined for performance testing results: 1) single performance metric (e.g. CPU Time from virtual environment vs. CPU Time from physical environment), 2) the relationship among performance metrics (e.g. correlation between CPU and I/O) and 3) performance models that are built to predict system performance. Our results show that 1) A single metric from virtual and physical environments do not follow the same distribution, hence practitioners cannot simply use a scaling factor to compare the performance between environments, 2) correlations among performance metrics in virtual environments are different from those in physical environments 3) statistical models built based on the performance metrics from virtual environments are different from the models built from physical environments suggesting that practitioners cannot use the performance testing results across virtual and physical environments. In order to assist the practitioners leverage performance testing results in both environments, we investigate ways to reduce the discrepancy. We find that such discrepancy can be reduced by normalizing performance metrics based on deviance. Overall, we suggest that practitioners should not use the performance testing results from virtual environment with the simple assumption of straightforward performance overhead. Instead, practitioners should consider leveraging normalization techniques to reduce the discrepancy before examining performance testing results from virtual and physical environments.',0,'Software performance engineering;Software performance analysis;Testing on virtual environments',0,'Testing;Measurement;Software engineering;Virtual environments;Correlation;Software performance,program testing;public domain software;software metrics;statistical analysis;virtual machines,performance metrics;performance testing environment;unre-alistic performance testing results;performance testing activities;physical environments;software systems;open source systems;Dell DVD store;CloudStore;practitioners leverage performance testing;virtual environments;scaling factor;statistical models','[Journal First] Empirical Study on the Discrepancy Between Performance Testing Results from Virtual and Physical Environments'),(3635,'Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software engineering paradigm where models are actively used to specify, test, simulate, analyse and maintain the systems to be built, among other activities. Models can be defined using general-purpose modelling languages like the UML, but for particular domains, the use of domain-specific languages is pervasive. Either way, models must conform to a meta-model which defines their abstract syntax. In MDE, the definition of model management operations - often typed over project-specific meta-models - is recurrent. However, even if two operations are similar, they must be developed from scratch whenever they are applied to instances of different meta-models. This is so as operations defined (i.e., typed) over a meta-model cannot be directly reused for another. Part of this difficulty of reuse is because classes in meta-models are used in two ways: as templates to create objects and as static classifiers for them. These two aspects are inherently tied in most meta-modelling approaches, which results in unnecessarily rigid systems and hinders reusability of MDE artefacts. To enhance flexibility and reuse in MDE, we propose an approach to decouple object creation from typing [1]. The approach relies on standard mechanisms for object creation, and proposes the notion of a posteriori typing as a means to retype objects and enable multiple, partial, dynamic typings. A posteriori typing enhances flexibility because it allows models to be retyped with respect to other meta-models. Hence, we distinguish between creation meta-models used to construct models, and role meta-models into which models are retyped. This permits unanticipated reuse, as a model management operation defined for a role meta-model can be reused as-is with models built using a different creation meta-model, once such models are reclassified. Moreover, our approach permits expressing some types of bidirectional model transformations by reclassification. The transformations defined as reclassifications have better performance than the equivalent ones defined with traditional transformation languages, because reclassification does not require creating new objects. In [1], we propose two mechanisms to define a posteriori typings: type-level (mappings between meta-models) and instance-level (set of model queries). The paper presents the underlying theory and type correctness criteria of both mechanisms, defines some analysis methods, identifies practical restrictions for retyping specifications, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by an implementation atop our meta-modelling tool MetaDepth. We also explore application scenarios of a posteriori typing (to define transformations, for model transformation reuse, and to improve transformation expressiveness by dynamic type change), and present an experiment showing the potential performance gains when expressing transformations as retypings.',0,'Model-driven engineering;reuse;model typing;partial typing;dynamic typing;model transformations;bidirectionality;MetaDepth',0,'Unified modeling language;Software engineering;Model driven engineering;Analytical models;Tools;Domain specific languages;Syntactics,formal specification;software engineering;software reusability;specification languages;Unified Modeling Language,posteriori typing;model transformation reuse;general-purpose modelling languages;model management operation;project-specific meta-models;meta-modelling approaches;creation meta-models;role meta-model;bidirectional model transformations;model queries;model-driven engineering;MetaDepth;meta-modelling tool','A Posteriori Typing for Model-Driven Engineering: Concepts, Analysis, and Applications'),(3642,'In software and hardware testing, generating multiple inputs which satisfy a given set of constraints is an important problem with applications in fuzz testing and stimulus generation.

To provide realistic context to f, it constructs an extended unit of f that consists of f and closely relevant functions to f.

Although academic research has moved beyond using technical debt only as a metaphor, and has begun compiling strong empirical evidence on the economic implications of technical debt, industry practitioners continue to find managing technical debt a challenging balancing act [3]. Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of managing technical debt in software product development, systematic processes for implementing technical debt management in software production have not been readily available. To address this gap, we developed and field tested a normative process framework that systematically incorporates steps for managing technical debt in commercial software production. The framework integrates processes required for technical debt management with existing software quality management processes prescribed by the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) [4], and organizes the different processes for technical debt management under three steps: (1) make technical debt visible, (2) perform cost-benefit analysis, and (3) control technical debt. To implement the processes, we introduce a new artifact, called the technical debt register, which stores, for each software asset, the outstanding principal and the associated interest estimated for the technical debt embedded in the asset. The technical debt register also stores the desired control target for each software asset\'s technical debt, which is populated and used during the cost-benefit analysis and control target calculations. There are three main benefits from this integrated approach. First, it enables the uncovering of hidden technical debt embedded in systems. Established quality assurance and control practices can be utilized to effectively associate software defects with specific design and deployment decisions made by programmers. Such associations make technical debt visible to the team and thereby facilitate the quantification of debt-related principal and interest. Second, it helps to bridge the gaps that exist between the technical and economic assessments of technical debt, and aid in formulating actionable policies related to technical debt management. Finally, integrating technical debt management processes with established quality frameworks aids the wider adoption of emerging prescriptions for managing technical debt. We partnered with three commercial software product development organizations to implement the framework in real-world software production settings. All three organizations, irrespective of their varying software process maturity levels, were able to adopt the proposed framework and integrate the prescribed technical debt management processes with their existing software quality management processes. Our longitudinal data and case-study interviews indicate that the organizations were able to accrue economic benefits from the adoption and use of the integrated framework.

Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective.

Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes.

First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis.

Grounded analysis of the data revealed an interplay between several different forces affecting the way in which developers handle privacy concerns. Borrowing the schema of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we classified and analyzed the cognitive, organizational and behavioral factors that play a role in developers\' privacy decision making. Our findings indicate that developers use the vocabulary of data security to approach privacy challenges, and that this vocabulary limits their perceptions of privacy mainly to third-party threats coming from outside of the organization; that organizational privacy climate is a powerful means for organizations to guide developers toward particular practices of privacy; and that software architectural patterns frame privacy solutions that are used throughout the development process, possibly explaining developers\' preference of policy-based solutions to architectural solutions. Further, we show, through the use of the SCT schema for framing the findings of this study, how a theoretical model of the factors that influence developers\' privacy practices can be conceptualized and used as a guide for future research toward effective implementation of PbD.',0,'Data protection;Privacy;Privacy by design;Qualitative research;Grounded analysis;Social cognitive theory;Organizational climate',0,'Privacy;Data privacy;Meteorology;Software;Information systems;Vocabulary;Software engineering,cognition;data privacy;decision making;security of data;software architecture,decision making;privacy by design;organizational privacy;data protection;software development process;software architectural patterns;informational privacy;privacy protection;PbD;policy-based solutions;data security;behavioral factors;Social Cognitive Theory;software design','[Journal First] Privacy by Designers: Software Developers\' Privacy Mindset'),(3748,'Dynamic languages, such as JavaScript, give programmers the freedom to ignore types, and enable them to write concise code in short time. Despite this freedom, many programs follow implicit type rules, for example, that a function has a particular signature or that a property has a particular type. Violations of such implicit type rules often correlate with problems in the program. This paper presents Type Devil, a mostly dynamic analysis that warns developers about inconsistent types. The key idea is to assign a set of observed types to each variable, property, and function, to merge types based in their structure, and to warn developers about variables, properties, and functions that have inconsistent types. To deal with the pervasiveness of polymorphic behavior in real-world JavaScript programs, we present a set of techniques to remove spurious warnings and to merge related warnings.

Due to dependencies between loop iterations, verification of code that contains loops is a hard problem, and typically requires manual assistance in the form of loop invariants. We present a fully automated technique that improves verifiability of loops. We first define co execution, a method for modeling loop iterations that simplifies automated reasoning about loops. Then, we present a fully automated static program analysis that detects whether the behavior of a given loop can be modeled using co execution. We provide a customized verification technique for co executable loops that results in more effective verification. In our experiments we observed that, in 45% of cases, modeling loops using co execution reduces verification time between 1 and 4 orders of magnitude.

In this paper we examine the extent to which a common set of factors such as the system platform, Java version, application starting state and tool harness configurations impact these metrics. We examine three layers of testing outputs: the code layer, the behavioral (or invariant) layer and the external (or user interaction) layer. In a study using five open source applications across three operating system platforms, manipulating several factors, we observe as many as 184 lines of code coverage difference between runs using the same test cases, and up to 96 percent false positives with respect to fault detection. We also see some a small variation among the invariants inferred. Despite our best efforts, we can reduce, but not completely eliminate all possible variation in the output.

Yet, in reality, incorrectly labelled (i.e., mislabelled) issue reports are likely non-random. In this paper, we study whether mislabelling is random, and the impact that realistic mislabelling has on the performance and interpretation of defect models.

We present a novel semantics-based repair method that generates the simplest patch such that the program structure of the buggy program is maximally preserved.

Conversely, we observe and argue that when it comes to realistically complex data structures and properties, the CLP specifications become more obscure, indirect, and difficult to implement and understand than their imperative counterparts.

Regression repair is then accomplished via a search over the code transformation operators - which operator to apply, and where. Our evaluation compares the repairability of relifix with GenProg on 35 real regression errors. relifix repairs 23 bugs, while GenProg only fixes five bugs.

While existing techniques can detect various types of performance bugs, a crucial and practical aspect of performance bugs has not received the attention it deserves: how likely are developers to fix a performance bug? In practice, fixing a performance bug can have both benefits and drawbacks, and developers fix a performance bug only when the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Unfortunately, for many performance bugs, the benefits and drawbacks are difficult to assess accurately. This paper presents CARAMEL, a novel static technique that detects and fixes performance bugs that have non-intrusive fixes likely to be adopted by developers. Each performance bug detected by CARAMEL is associated with a loop and a condition. When the condition becomes true during the loop execution, all the remaining computation performed by the loop is wasted. Developers typically fix such performance bugs because these bugs waste computation in loops and have non-intrusive fixes: when some condition becomes true dynamically, just break out of the loop. Given a program, CARAMEL detects such bugs statically and gives developers a potential source-level fix for each bug.

An experiment on 5 real-life medium-sized programs with 18, 920 multiple-fault versions, which are shipped with number of faults ranging from 2 to 8, has been conducted to evaluate the technique. The results indicate that the performance of the technique in terms of evaluation measures precision, recall, and F-measure is promising. In addition, for the identified failing tests that executed a single fault, the technique can also properly cluster them.',1,'distance calculation;fault localization;binary classification;debugging',46,'Maintenance engineering;Fault diagnosis;Debugging;Indexes;Software;Classification algorithms;Testing,pattern classification;program debugging;program testing;software fault tolerance;software maintenance,failing test classification;debugging;software development;software maintenance;single-fault failure assumption;fault localization;evaluation measures precision;recall;F-measure','Does the Failing Test Execute a Single or Multiple Faults?

In this paper, we examine the potential for software design competitions to incorporate recombination, in which competing designers are given the designs of others and encouraged to use them to revise their own designs. To explore this, we conducted two software design competitions in which participants were asked to produce both an initial and a revised design, drawing on lessons learned from the crowd. We found that, in both competitions, all participants borrowed ideas and most improved the quality of their designs.

A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms.

Testing large systems such as the Microsoft Windows operating system requires complex test infrastructures, which may lead to test failures caused by faulty tests and test infrastructure issues. Such false test alarms are particular annoying as they raise engineer attention and require manual inspection without providing any benefit. The goal of this work is to use empirical data to minimize the number of false test alarms reported during system and integration testing. To achieve this goal, we use association rule learning to identify patterns among failing test steps that are typically for false test alarms and can be used to automatically classify them.

First, the data are imbalanced -- there are much fewer buggy changes than clean changes. Second, the commonly used cross-validation approach is inappropriate for evaluating the performance of change classification.

Prior research has proposed the automation of such analysis through the mining of historical performance data (e.g., CPU and memory usage) from prior test runs. Nevertheless, such research has had limited adoption in practice. Working with a large industrial performance testing lab, we noted that a major hurdle in the adoption of prior work (including our own work) is the incorrect assumption that prior tests are always executed in the same environment (i.e., labs). All too often, tests are performed in heterogenous environments with each test being run in a possibly different lab with different hardware and software configurations. To make automated performance regression analysis techniques work in industry, we propose to model the global expected behaviour of a system as an ensemble (combination) of individual models, one for each successful previous test run (and hence configuration). The ensemble of models of prior test runs are used to flag performance deviations (e.g., CPU counters showing higher usage) in new tests.

This so-called \"extended cognition\" shapes human relations in a radically new way. It is accompanied by a decrease of shared attention and affective presence within closely related groups. This weakens the deepest and most important bonds, that used to shape human identity.

Method: The comparison was made in the context of two test-driven development experiments conducted with students in an academic setting and with professionals in a software organization. We measured the code quality of several tasks implemented by both subject groups and checked whether students and professionals perform similarly in terms of code quality metrics. Results: Except for minor differences, neither of the subject groups is better than the other. Professionals produce larger, yet less complex, methods when they use their traditional development approach, whereas both subject groups perform similarly when they apply a new approach for the first time.

Although this problem has been the subject of intensive research in recent years, existing methods are rarely adopted by developers in practice since they do not produce sufficiently accurate fault explanations for real applications. Our new method is significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods for explaining failed regression tests in real applications, due to its synergistic analysis framework that iteratively applies both dynamic analysis and a constraint solver based semantic analysis to leverage their complementary strengths.

Specifically, we identify the important factors for determining where to log and extract them as structural features, textual features, and syntactic features. Then, by applying machine learning techniques (e.g., Feature selection and classifier learning) and noise handling techniques, we achieve high accuracy of logging suggestions. We evaluate Log Advisor on two industrial software systems from Microsoft and two open-source software systems from Git Hub (totally 19.1M LOC and 100.6K logging statements). The encouraging experimental results, as well as a user study, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our logging suggestion tool. We believe our work can serve as an important first step towards the goal of \"learning to log\".',40,'',48,'Feature extraction;Software systems;Context;Data mining;Runtime;Syntactics,learning (artificial intelligence);programming;public domain software,logging programming practice;logging decisions;system runtime information;postmortem analysis;strategic logging placement;learning-to-log framework;Log Advisor logging suggestion tool;machine learning techniques;noise handling techniques;logging suggestions;industrial software systems;Microsoft;open-source software systems;Git Hub','Learning to Log: Helping Developers Make Informed Logging Decisions'),(4687,'Test cases that drive an application under test via its graphical user interface (GUI) consist of sequences of steps that perform actions on, or verify the state of, the application user interface. Such tests can be hard to maintain, especially if they are not properly modularized - that is, common steps occur in many test cases, which can make test maintenance cumbersome and expensive. Performing modularization manually can take up considerable human effort. To address this, we present an automated approach for modularizing GUI test cases. Our approach consists of multiple phases. In the first phase, it analyzes individual test cases to partition test steps into candidate subroutines, based on how user-interface elements are accessed in the steps. This phase can analyze the test cases only or also leverage execution traces of the tests, which involves a cost-accuracy tradeoff. In the second phase, the technique compares candidate subroutines across test cases, and refines them to compute the final set of subroutines. In the last phase, it creates callable subroutines, with parameterized data and control flow, and refactors the original tests to call the subroutines with context-specific data and control parameters.

Data sharing is the fundamental step of cross project defect prediction, i.e. the process of using data from one project to predict for defects in another. Prior work on secure data sharing allowed data owners to share their data on a single-party basis for defect prediction via data minimization and obfuscation. However the studied method did not consider that bigger data required the data owner to share more of their data. In this paper, we extend previous work with LACE2 which reduces the amount of data shared by using multi-party data sharing. Here data owners incrementally add data to a cache passed among them and contribute \"interesting\" data that are not similar to the current content of the cache. Also, before data owner i passes the cache to data owner j, privacy is preserved by applying obfuscation algorithms to hide project details. The experiments of this paper show that (a) LACE2 is comparatively less expensive than the single-party approach and (b) the multi-party approach of LACE2 yields higher privacy than the prior approach without damaging predictive efficacy (indeed, in some cases, LACE2 leads to better defect predictors).',25,'privacy-preserving data sharing;cross project defect prediction',44,'Data privacy;Privacy;Software;Minimization;Organizations;Measurement;Clustering algorithms,cache storage;data encapsulation;data privacy;project management;security of data;software development management,LACE2;privacy-preserving data sharing;cross project defect prediction;secure data sharing;data minimization;multiparty data sharing;cache;interesting data;obfuscation algorithm;project detail hiding;single-party approach;multiparty approach','LACE2: Better Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing for Cross Project Defect Prediction'),(4704,'Predictive trace analysis (PTA) is an effective approach for detecting subtle bugs in concurrent programs.

In addition, most techniques assume as input a globally ordered trace of events, which is expensive to collect in practice as it requires synchronizing all threads. In this paper, we present GPredict: a new technique that realizes PTA for generic concurrency properties. Moreover, GPredict does not require a global trace but only the local traces of each thread, which incurs much less runtime overhead than existing techniques. Our key idea is to uniformly model violations of concurrency properties and the thread causality as constraints over events. With an existing SMT solver, GPredict is able to precisely predict property violations allowed by the causal model. Through our evaluation using both benchmarks and real world applications, we show that GPredict is effective in expressing and predicting generic property violations.

A thorough comparison among the recovery techniques is needed to understand their effectiveness and applicability. This study improves on previous studies in two ways. First, we study the impact of leveraging more accurate symbol dependencies on the accuracy of architecture recovery techniques. Previous studies have not seriously considered how the quality of the input might affect the quality of the output for architecture recovery techniques. Second, we study a system (Chromium) that is substantially larger (9.7 million lines of code) than those included in previous studies. Obtaining the ground-truth architecture of Chromium involved two years of collaboration with its developers. As part of this work we developed a new sub module-based technique to recover preliminary versions of ground-truth architectures. The other systems that we study have been examined previously. In some cases, we have updated the ground-truth architectures to newer versions, and in other cases we have corrected newly discovered inconsistencies. Our evaluation of nine variants of six state-of-the-art architecture recovery techniques shows that symbol dependencies generally produce architectures with higher accuracies than include dependencies. Despite this improvement, the overall accuracy is low for all recovery techniques. The results suggest that (1) in addition to architecture recovery techniques, the accuracy of dependencies used as their inputs is another factor to consider for high recovery accuracy, and (2) more accurate recovery techniques are needed.

Business management, marketing, and accounting subjects were added to the new curriculum, and students made information technology (IT) business plans using their knowledge of software engineering and business management.

This combined approach also enables the cross-checking of each component for reliable and robust testing results.',7,'symbolic execution;model checking;data flow coverage;data flow testing;coverage criteria',61,'Search problems;Model checking;Discrete Fourier transforms;Software;Engines;Safety,data flow computing;formal verification;program testing;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software performance evaluation,data flow testing;fault-detection ability;structural testing;hybrid DFT framework;dynamic symbolic execution;DSE;guided path search;performance testing;software model checking;open source program;industrial program','Combining Symbolic Execution and Model Checking for Data Flow Testing'),(5185,'The conception of reliable smart spaces requires a suitable and comprehensive framework for their design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

The regression testing of concurrent programs often requires running a failing test for weeks before catching a faulty interleaving, due to the myriad of possible interleavings of memory accesses arising from concurrent program executions. As a result, the conventional approach that selects a sub-set of test cases for regression testing without considering interleavings is insufficient. In this paper we present RECONTEST to address the problem by selecting the new interleavings that arise due to code changes. These interleavings must be explored in order to uncover regression bugs. RECONTEST efficiently selects new interleavings by first identifying shared memory accesses that are affected by the changes, and then exploring only those problematic interleavings that contain at least one of these accesses. We have implemented RECONTEST as an automated tool and evaluated it using 13 real-world concurrent program subjects.

We propose a novel approach DFixer to fix deadlocks without introducing any new deadlocks by design. DFixer only selects one thread of a deadlock to pre-acquire a lock w together with another lock h, where before fixing, the deadlock occurs when the thread holds lock h and waits for lock w. As such, DFixer eliminates a hold-and-wait necessary condition, preventing the deadlock from occurring. The thread per-forming pre-acquisition is carefully selected such that no other syn-chronization exists in between the two original acquisitions. Other-wise, DFixer further introduces a context-aware conditional protect-ed by above lock w to guarantee the correctness of DFixer. The evaluation is on 20 deadlocks, including 17 from widely-used real-world C/C++ programs. It shows that DFixer successfully fixed all deadlocks.

To build accurate prediction models, previous studies focus on manually designing features that encode the characteristics of programs and exploring different machine learning algorithms. Existing traditional features often fail to capture the semantic differences of programs, and such a capability is needed for building accurate prediction models. To bridge the gap between programs\' semantics and defect prediction features, this paper proposes to leverage a powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn semantic representation of programs automatically from source code. Specifically, we leverage Deep Belief Network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features from token vectors extracted from programs\' Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Our evaluation on ten open source projects shows that our automatically learned semantic features significantly improve both within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) compared to traditional features. Our semantic features improve WPDP on average by 14.7% in precision, 11.5% in recall, and 14.2% in F1.

Existing differential testing frameworks such as CyFuzz can not generate models rich in language features, partly because these tool chains do not leverage the available informal Simulink specifications. Furthermore, no study of existing Simulink models is available, which could guide CyFuzz to generate realistic models.

Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases.

At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults.

Doing so, we can address specific performance and usability requirements that we identified in a literature survey of CDA usage scenarios. In an experimental evaluation, our algorithm suite computes conflicts and dependencies rapidly.

However, it is impractical to assess all of the possible settings in the parameter spaces.

Intuitively, given a set of expected goals to be achieved by the system-to-be, a conflict represents a subtle situation that makes goals diverge, i.e., not be satisfiable as a whole. Conflict analysis is typically driven by the identify-assess-control cycle, aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving conflicts that may obstruct the satisfaction of the expected goals. In particular, the assessment step is concerned with evaluating how likely the identified conflicts are, and how likely and severe are their consequences. So far, existing assessment approaches restrict their analysis to obstacles (conflicts that prevent the satisfaction of a single goal), and assume that certain probabilistic information on the domain is provided, that needs to be previously elicited from experienced users, statistical data or simulations. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to assess how likely a conflict is, that applies to general conflicts (not only obstacles) without requiring probabilistic information on the domain.

Therefore, it is not clear whether the conclusions drawn by existing work in test prioritization from the artificial changes are still valid for real-world software evolution. In this paper, we present the first empirical study to investigate this important threat to validity in test prioritization. We reimplemented 24 variant techniques of both the traditional and time-aware test prioritization, and investigated the impacts of software evolution on those techniques based on the version history of 8 real-world Java programs from GitHub. The results show that for both traditional and time-aware test prioritization, test suite augmentation significantly hampers their effectiveness, whereas source code changes alone do not influence their effectiveness much.',9,'',67,'Testing;Software systems;Schedules;Time factors;Instruments;Software engineering,program testing;software engineering,regression test prioritization;real-world software evolution;fault detection;prioritization techniques;software development;test suite augmentation;GitHub','How Does Regression Test Prioritization Perform in Real-World Software Evolution?'),(5835,'Event-driven programming frameworks, such as Android, are based on components with asynchronous interfaces.

While useful, these specifications are not commonly available, because writing them is difficult and error-prone. Our goal is to make the task of producing callback typestates significantly easier. We present a callback typestate assistant tool, DroidStar, that requires only limited user interaction to produce a callback typestate. Our approach is based on an active learning algorithm, L*.

However, programmers often also have strongly-held a priori opinions about these issues. These opinions are important, since developers are highlytrained professionals whose beliefs would doubtless affect their practice. As in evidence-based medicine, disseminating empirical findings to developers is a key step in ensuring that the findings impact practice. In this paper, we describe a case study, on the prior beliefs of developers at Microsoft, and the relationship of these beliefs to actual empirical data on the projects in which these developers work. Our findings are that a) programmers do indeed have very strong beliefs on certain topics b) their beliefs are primarily formed based on personal experience, rather than on findings in empirical research and c) beliefs can vary with each project, but do not necessarily correspond with actual evidence in that project.

The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner-case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons.

Dynamic analysis tools like Valgrind can detect these errors, but their overhead - primarily due to the cost of instrumenting every memory read and write - makes them too heavyweight for use in deployed applications and makes testing with them painfully slow. The result is that much deployed software remains susceptible to these bugs, which are notoriously difficult to track down.This paper presents evidence-based dynamic analysis, an approach that enables these analyses while imposing minimal overhead (under 5%), making it practical for the first time to perform these analyses in deployed settings. The key insight of evidence-based dynamic analysis is that for a class of errors, it is possible to ensure that evidence that they happened at some point in the past remains for later detection. Evidence-based dynamic analysis allows execution to proceed at nearly full speed until the end of an epoch (e.g., a heavyweight system call). It then examines program state to check for evidence that an error occurred at some time during that epoch. If so, it rolls back execution and re-executes the code with instrumentation activated to pinpoint the error.We present DoubleTake, a prototype evidence-based dynamic analysis framework. DoubleTake is practical and easy to deploy, requiring neither custom hardware, compiler, nor operating system support. We demonstrate DoubleTake\'s generality and efficiency by building dynamic analyses that find buffer overflows, memory use-after-free errors, and memory leaks. Our evaluation shows that DoubleTake is efficient, imposing under 5% overhead on average, making it the fastest such system to date. It is also precise: DoubleTake pinpoints the location of these errors to the exact line and memory addresses where they occur, providing valuable debugging information to programmers.',8,'Dynamic Analysis;Software Quality;Testing;Debugging;Leak Detection;Buffer Overflow Detection;Use-After-Free Detection',43,'Instruments;Testing;Detectors;Hardware;Operating systems;Resource management;Software engineering,program debugging;program diagnostics,error detection;evidence-based dynamic analysis;Valgrind tool;DoubleTake;buffer overflow;memory use-after-free errors;memory leaks;debugging information','DoubleTake: Fast and Precise Error Detection via Evidence-Based Dynamic Analysis'),(5883,'Many efforts have been paid to enhance the security of Android. However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead.

While it has also been applied in the context of JavaScript (JS) programs, we observe that applying concolic testing to dynamically-typed JS programs involves tackling unique problems to ensure scalability. In particular, a naive type-agnostic extension of concolic testing to JS programs causes generation of large number of inputs. Consequently, many executions operate on undefined values and repeatedly explore same paths resulting in redundant tests, thus diminishing the scalability of testing drastically. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a simple yet effective approach that incorporates type-awareness intelligently in conventional concolic testing to reduce the number of generated inputs for JS programs. We extend our approach inter-procedurally by generating preconditions for each function that provide a summary of the relation between the variable types and paths. Employing the function preconditions when testing reduces the number of inputs generated even further. We implement our ideas and validate it on a number of open-source JS programs (and libraries).

These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of non- dominated solutions.

These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files.

The results show that the speed of bug finding decreases linearly with the degree of variability, while effectiveness of finding bugs is relatively independent of the degree of variability. Still, identifying the set of configurations in which the bug manifests itself is difficult already for a low degree of variability.

In the meantime, IOs can be used intentionally by programmers for benign purposes such as hashing and random number generation. Hence, differentiating exploitable and harmful IOs from intentional and benign ones is an important challenge. It allows reducing the number of false positives produced by IO vulnerability detection techniques, helping developers or security analysts to focus on fxing critical IOs without inspecting the numerous false alarms. The difficulty of recognizing benign IOs mainly lies in inferring the intent of programmers from source code. In this paper, we present a novel technique to recognize benign IOs via equivalence checking across multiple precisions. We determine if an IO is benign by comparing the effects of an overflowed integer arithmetic operation in the actual world (with limited precision) and the same operation in the ideal world (with sufficient precision to evade the IO). Specifically, we first extract the data flow path from the overflowed integer arithmetic operation to a security-related program point (i.e., sink) and then create a new version of the path using more precise types with sufficient bits to represent integers so that the IO can be avoided. Using theorem proving we check whether these two versions are equivalent, that is, if they yield the same values at the sink under all possible inputs. If so, the IO is benign. We implement a prototype, named IntEQ, based on the GCC compiler and the Z3 solver, and evaluate it using 26 harmful IO vulnerabilities from 20 real-world programs, and 444 benign IOs from SPECINT 2000, SPECINT 2006, and 7 real-world applications.

We also characterize a key tradeoff in the structure of the search spaces. Larger and richer search spaces that contain correct patches for more defects can actually cause systems to find fewer, not more, correct patches.

Cross-project defect prediction has been the main area of progress by reusing classifiers from other projects. However, existing approaches require some degree of homogeneity (e.g., a similar distribution of metric values) between the training projects and the target project. Satisfying the homogeneity requirement often requires significant effort (currently a very active area of research). An unsupervised classifier does not require any training data, therefore the heterogeneity challenge is no longer an issue. In this paper, we examine two types of unsupervised classifiers: a) distance-based classifiers (e.g., k-means); and b) connectivity-based classifiers. While distance-based unsupervised classifiers have been previously used in the defect prediction literature with disappointing performance, connectivity-based classifiers have never been explored before in our community. We compare the performance of unsupervised classifiers versus supervised classifiers using data from 26 projects from three publicly available datasets (i.e., AEEEM, NASA, and PROMISE).

Besides, various semantics-equivalent representations are normalized into a canonical form. Eventually, the mining process can be performed on a refined code database, and false positives and false negatives can be significantly pruned. We have implemented AntMiner and applied it to detect bugs in the Linux kernel. It reported 52 violations that have been either confirmed as real bugs by the kernel development community or fixed in new kernel versions. Among them, 41 cannot be detected by a widely used representative analysis tool Coverity. Besides, the result of a comparative analysis shows that our approach can effectively improve the precision of code mining and detect subtle bugs that have previously been missed.',5,'Bug detection;Code mining;Program slicing',50,'Computer bugs;Data mining;Kernel;Programming;Linux;Databases,data mining;Linux;operating system kernels;program debugging;program slicing,AntMiner approach;noise interference reduction;bug detection;code mining;source code preprocessing;program slicing technique;semantics-equivalent representation;Linux kernel;Coverity tool','AntMiner: Mining More Bugs by Reducing Noise Interference'),(6227,'The inception of a mobile app often takes form of a mock-up of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), represented as a static image delineating the proper layout and style of GUI widgets that satisfy requirements. Following this initial mock-up, the design artifacts are then handed off to developers whose goal is to accurately implement these GUIs and the desired functionality in code. Given the sizable abstraction gap between mock-ups and code, developers often introduce mistakes related to the GUI that can negatively impact an app\'s success in highly competitive marketplaces. Moreover, such mistakes are common in the evolutionary context of rapidly changing apps. This leads to the time-consuming and laborious task of design teams verifying that each screen of an app was implemented according to intended design specifications. This paper introduces a novel, automated approach for verifying whether the GUI of a mobile app was implemented according to its intended design. Our approach resolves GUI-related information from both implemented apps and mock-ups and uses computer vision techniques to identify common errors in the implementations of mobile GUIs. We implemented this approach for Android in a tool called GVT and carried out both a controlled empirical evaluation with open-source apps as well as an industrial evaluation with designers and developers from Huawei. The results show that GVT solves an important, difficult, and highly practical problem with remarkable efficiency and accuracy and is both useful and scalable from the point of view of industrial designers and developers.

Test minimization aims at removing redundant test cases. However, current techniques remove whole test cases from the test suite using test adequacy criteria, such as code coverage. This has two limitations, namely (1) by removing a whole test case the corresponding test assertions are also lost, which can inhibit test suite effectiveness, (2) the issue of partly redundant test cases, i.e., tests with redundant test statements, is ignored. We propose a novel approach for fine-grained test case minimization. Our analysis is based on the inference of a test suite model that enables automated test reorganization within test cases. It enables removing redundancies at the test statement level, while preserving the coverage and test assertions of the test suite. We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called Testler, on the test suites of 15 open source projects. Our analysis shows that over 4,639 (24%) of the tests in these test suites are partly redundant, with over 11,819 redundant test statements in total. Our results show that Testler removes 43% of the redundant test statements, reducing the number of partly redundant tests by 52%.

Results afford some doubt that lambdas benefit developers and show evidence that students are negatively impacted in regard to how quickly they can write correct programs to a test specification and whether they can complete a task. Analysis from log data shows that participants spent more time with compiler errors, and have more errors, when using lambdas as compared to iterators, suggesting difficulty with the syntax chosen for C++.

As a result, one library may inadvertently modify or even delete the APIs of another library, causing unexpected behavior of library clients. Given the quickly increasing number of libraries, manually keeping track of such conflicts is practically impossible both for library developers and users. This paper presents ConflictJS, an automated and scalable approach to analyze libraries for conflicts. The key idea is to tackle the huge search space of possible conflicts in two phases. At first, a dynamic analysis of individual libraries identifies pairs of potentially conflicting libraries. Then, targeted test synthesis validates potential conflicts by creating a client application that suffers from a conflict. The overall approach is free of false positives, in the sense that it reports a problem only when such a client exists. We use ConflictJS to analyze and study conflicts among 951 real-world libraries. The results show that one out of four libraries is potentially conflicting and that 166 libraries are involved in at least one certain conflict.

The query does not need to contain framework-specific trivia such as the type names or methods of interest. We translate user queries into the APIs of interest using clickthrough data from the Bing search engine. Then, based on patterns learned from open-source code repositories, we synthesize idiomatic code describing the use of these APIs. We introduce structured call sequences to capture API-usage patterns. Structured call sequences are a generalized form of method call sequences, with if-branches and while-loops to represent conditional and repeated API usage patterns, and are simple to extract and amenable to synthesis.

Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions). These results confirm our intuition that our proposed transformations form a sufficient set of operators to patch crashes in Android.',6,'Automated repair;Android apps;Crash;SBSE',0,'Computer crashes;Androids;Humanoid robots;Maintenance engineering;Mobile applications;Transistors;Testing,Android (operating system);program testing,Android apps;test-based repair approaches;benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes','Repairing Crashes in Android Apps'),(6299,'Regression testing checks that recent project changes do not break previously working functionality. Although important, regression testing is costly when changes are frequent. Regression test selection (RTS) optimizes regression testing by running only tests whose results might be affected by a change. Traditionally, RTS collects dependencies (e.g., on files) for each test and skips the tests, at a new project revision, whose dependencies did not change. Existing RTS techniques do not differentiate behavior-preserving transformations (i.e., refactorings) from other code changes. As a result, tests are run more frequently than necessary. We present the first step towards a refactoring-aware RTS technique, dubbed Reks, which skips tests affected only by behavior-preserving changes. Reks defines rules to update the test dependencies without running the tests. To ensure that Reks does not hide any bug introduced by the refactoring engines, we integrate Reks only in the pre-submit testing phase, which happens on the developers\' machines. We evaluate Reks by measuring the savings in the testing effort. Specifically, we reproduce 100 refactoring tasks performed by developers of 37 projects on GitHub. Our results show that Reks would not run, on average, 33% of available tests (that would be run by a refactoring-unaware RTS technique). Additionally, we systematically run 27 refactoring types on ten projects. The results, based on 74,160 refactoring tasks, show that Reks would not run, on average, 16% of tests (max: 97% and SD: 24%).

This requires re-thinking the notion of step-through debugging in a traditional debugger such as gdb, because pausing the entire computation across distributed worker nodes causes significant delay and naively inspecting millions of records using a watchpoint is too time consuming for an end user.First, BigDebug\'s simulated breakpoints and on-demand watchpoints allow users to selectively examine distributed, intermediate data on the cloud with little overhead. Second, a user can also pinpoint a crash-inducing record and selectively resume relevant sub-computations after a quick fix. Third, a user can determine the root causes of errors (or delays) at the level of individual records through a fine-grained data provenance capability.

An alternative approach, successfully used in end-user synthesis, is programming by example (PBE), where the user leverages examples to interactively and iteratively refine the intent. However, using only examples is not expressive enough for programmers, who can observe the generated program and refine the intent by directly relating to parts of the generated program.

A common industrial practice to identify code quality concerns early on are code reviews. While code reviews help to identify problems early on, they also impose costs on development and only take place after a code change is already completed. The goal of our research is to automatically identify code quality concerns while a developer is making a change to the code. By using biometrics, such as heart rate variability, we aim to determine the difficulty a developer experiences working on a part of the code as well as identify and help to fix code quality concerns before they are even committed to the repository. In a field study with ten professional developers over a two-week period we investigated the use of biometrics to determine code quality concerns. Our results show that biometrics are indeed able to predict quality concerns of parts of the code while a developer is working on, improving upon a naive classifier by more than 26% and outperforming classifiers based on more traditional metrics. In a second study with five professional developers from a different country and company, we found evidence that some of our findings from our initial study can be replicated.

Although modern code reviews rely heavily on human interactions, little is known regarding whether they are performed fairly. Fairness plays a role in any process where decisions that affect others are made. When a system is perceived to be unfair, it affects negatively the productivity and motivation of its participants. In this paper, using fairness theory we create a framework that describes how fairness affects modern code reviews. To demonstrate its applicability, and the importance of fairness in code reviews, we conducted an em-pirical study that asked developers of a large industrial open source ecosystem (OpenStack) what their perceptions are regarding fairness in their code reviewing process. Our study shows that, in general, the code review process in OpenStack is perceived as fair; however, a significant portion of respondents perceive it as unfair. We also show that the variability in the way they prioritize code reviews signals a lack of consistency and the existence of bias (potentially increasing the perception of unfairness).

Dinv uses static and dynamic program analyses to infer relations between variables at different nodes. For example, in a leader election algorithm, Dinv can relate the variable leader at different nodes to derive the invariant forall ∀ nodes i, j, leader_i = leader_j. This can increase the developer\'s confidence in the correctness of their system. The developer can also use Dinv to convert an inferred invariant into a distributed runtime assertion on distributed state. We applied Dinv to several popular distributed systems, such as etcd Raft, Hashicorp Serf, and Taipei-Torrent, which have between 1.7K and 144K LOC and are widely used.

Second, the search space is huge and therefore the correct patch cannot be generated (ie correct patches are either generated after incorrect plausible ones or not generated within the time budget). To increase the likelihood of including the correct patches in the search space, we propose to work at a fine granularity in terms of AST nodes. This, however, will further enlarge the search space, increasing the challenge to find the correct patches.

Studies in other areas have found that this practice has both negative and positive effects on individuals\' work. However, there are only few studies addressing this issue in software engineering so far. The goal of our study is to investigate the effects of job rotation on work related factors in software engineering by performing a qualitative case study on a large software organization that uses job rotation as an organizational practice. We interviewed senior managers, project managers, and software engineers that had experienced this practice. Altogether, 48 participants were involved in all phases of this research. Collected data was analyzed using qualitative coding techniques and the results were checked and validated with participants through member checking. Our findings suggest that it is necessary to find balance between the positive effects on work variety and learning opportunities, and negative effects on cognitive workload and performance. Further, the lack of feedback resulting from constant movement among projects and teams may have a negative impact on performance feedback. We conclude that job rotation is an important organizational practice with important positive results. However, managers must be aware of potential negative effects and deploy tactics to balance them. We discuss such tactics in this article.',2,'job rotation;software teams;performance;software engineering;case study',39,'Multiskilling;Software;Software engineering;Companies;Interviews;Context,organisational aspects;software development management,job rotation theory;software engineering;organizational practice;work related factors;qualitative case study;qualitative coding techniques;cognitive workload;cognitive performance','Building a Theory of Job Rotation in Software Engineering from an Instrumental Case Study'),(6611,'Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique, but it is difficult to apply to programs built using frameworks such as Swing and Android, because the framework code itself is hard to symbolically execute. The standard solution is to manually create a framework model that can be symbolically executed, but developing and maintaining a model is difficult and error-prone. In this paper, we present Pasket, a new system that takes a first step toward automatically generating Java framework models to support symbolic execution. Pasket\'s focus is on creating models by instantiating design patterns. Pasket takes as input class, method, and type information from the framework API, together with tutorial programs that exercise the framework. From these artifacts and Pasket\'s internal knowledge of design patterns, Pasket synthesizes a framework model whose behavior on the tutorial programs matches that of the original framework. We evaluated Pasket by synthesizing models for subsets of Swing and Android. Our results show that the models derived by Pasket are sufficient to allow us to use off-the-shelf symbolic execution tools to analyze Java programs that rely on frameworks.',3,'Program Synthesis;Framework Model;Symbolic Execution;Sketch',40,'Tutorials;Java;Androids;Humanoid robots;Observers;Analytical models;Synthesizers,Java;object-oriented programming;program diagnostics,symbolic execution;program analysis;PASKET;Java framework models;design pattern instantiation;API;Swing;Android','Synthesizing Framework Models for Symbolic Execution'),(6624,'The record-and-replay approach for software testing is important and valuable for developers in designing mobile applications. However, the existing solutions for recording and replaying Android applications are far from perfect. When considering the richness of mobile phones\' input capabilities including touch screen, sensors, GPS, etc., existing approaches either fall short of covering all these different input types, or require elevated privileges that are not easily attained and can be dangerous. In this paper, we present a novel system, called MobiPlay, which aims to improve record-and-replay testing. By collaborating between a mobile phone and a server, we are the first to capture all possible inputs by doing so at the application layer, instead of at the Android framework layer or the Linux kernel layer, which would be infeasible without a server. MobiPlay runs the to-be-tested application on the server under exactly the same environment as the mobile phone, and displays the GUI of the application in real time on a thin client application installed on the mobile phone. From the perspective of the mobile phone user, the application appears to be local. We have implemented our system and evaluated it with tens of popular mobile applications showing that MobiPlay is efficient, flexible, and comprehensive. It can record all input data, including all sensor data, all touchscreen gestures, and GPS. It is able to record and replay on both the mobile phone and the server.

They leave executions unverified when they do not check certain properties, fail to verify properties, or check properties under certain unsound assumptions such as the absence of arithmetic overflow. In this paper, we present a technique to complement partial verification results by automatic test case generation. In contrast to existing work, our technique supports the common case that the verification results are based on unsound assumptions. We annotate programs to reflect which executions have been verified, and under which assumptions. These annotations are then used to guide dynamic symbolic execution toward unverified program executions. Our main technical contribution is a code instrumentation that causes dynamic symbolic execution to abort tests that lead to verified executions, to prune parts of the search space, and to prioritize tests that cover more properties that are not fully verified. We have implemented our technique for the .NET static analyzer Clousot and the dynamic symbolic execution tool Pex. It produces smaller test suites (by up to 19.2%), covers more unverified executions (by up to 7.1%), and reduces testing time (by up to 52.4%) compared to combining Clousot and Pex without our technique.',5,'static analysis;program verification;testing;partial verification;dynamic symbolic execution',41,'Testing;Instruments;Redundancy;Aerospace electronics;Conferences;Software engineering;Performance analysis,program testing,dynamic symbolic execution;unverified program execution;program error detection;program execution;arithmetic overflow;automatic test case generation;code instrumentation;Clousot;Pex tool','Guiding Dynamic Symbolic Execution toward Unverified Program Executions'),(6637,'Request-based applications, e.g., most server-side applications, expose services to users in a request-based paradigm, in which requests are served by request-handler methods. An important task for request-based applications is inter-request analysis, which analyzes request-handler methods that are related by inter-request data dependencies together. However, in the request-based paradigm, data dependencies between related request-handler methods are implicitly established by the underlying frameworks that execute these methods. As a result, existing analysis tools are usually limited to the scope of each single method without the knowledge of dependencies between different methods. In this paper, we design an approach called dataflow tunneling to capture inter-request data dependencies from concrete application executions and produce data-dependency specifications. Our approach answers two key questions: (1) what request-handler methods have data dependencies and (2) what these data dependencies are. Our evaluation using applications developed with two representative and popular frameworks shows that our approach is general and accurate.

However, the code snippets in such a forum often contain undeclared, ambiguous, or largely unqualified external references. Such declaration ambiguity and external reference ambiguity present challenges for developers in learning to correctly use the APIs. In this paper, we propose StatType, a statistical approach to resolve the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the API elements in such code snippets. Unlike existing approaches that are based on heuristics, StatType has two well-integrated factors. We first learn from a large training code corpus the FQNs that often co-occur. Then, to derive the FQN for an API name in a code snippet, we use that knowledge and leverage the context consisting of neighboring API names. To realize those factors, we treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that StatType achieves very high accuracy with 97.6% precision and 96.7% recall, which is 16.5% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art approach.',3,'Type Resolution;Type Inference;Type Annotations;Partial Program Analysis;Statistical Machine Translation;Naturalness;Big Code',0,'Computational modeling;Software libraries;Training;Software;Tools,application program interfaces;Internet;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);software libraries;statistical analysis,machine translation;StackOverflow posts;API fully qualified names;statistical learning;partially qualified names;source code;API name;training code corpus;API elements;FQNs;statistical approach;StatType;external reference;declaration ambiguity;code snippet;software libraries;online forums;software developers','Statistical Learning of API Fully Qualified Names in Code Snippets of Online Forums'),(6652,'Smartphone users suffer from insucient information on how commercial as well as malicious apps handle sensitive data stored on their phones. Automated taint analyses address this problem by allowing users to detect and investigate how applications access and handle this data. A current problem with virtually all those analysis approaches is, though, that they rely on explicit models of the Android runtime library. In most cases, the existence of those models is taken for granted, despite the fact that the models are hard to come by: Given the size and evolution speed of a modern smartphone operating system it is prohibitively expensive to derive models manually from code or documentation. In this work, we therefore present StubDroid, the first fully automated approach for inferring precise and efficient library models for taint-analysis problems. StubDroid automatically constructs these summaries from a binary distribution of the library. In our experiments, we use StubDroid-inferred models to prevent the static taint analysis FlowDroid from having to re-analyze the Android runtime library over and over again for each analyzed app. As the results show, the models make it possible to analyze apps in seconds whereas most complete re-analyses would time out after 30 minutes. Yet, StubDroid yields comparable precision.

The advent of software ecosystems like GitHub has enabled something new: the ability to easily switch between projects. Developers also have social incentives to contribute to many projects; prolific contributors gain social recognition and (eventually) economic rewards. Multitasking, however, comes at a cognitive cost: frequent context-switches can lead to distraction, sub-standard work, and even greater stress. In this paper, we gather ecosystem-level data on a group of programmers working on a large collection of projects. We develop models and methods for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers\' context-switching behavior, and we study how context-switching affects their productivity. We also survey developers to understand the reasons for and perceptions of multitasking. We find that the most common reason for multitasking is interrelationships and dependencies between projects. Notably, we find that the rate of switching and breadth (number of projects) of a developer\'s work matter. Developers who work on many projects have higher productivity if they focus on few projects per day. Developers that switch projects too much during the course of a day have lower productivity as they work on more projects overall.

In this paper, we propose a novel Neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks with constraint-based reasoning. Specifically, our method first uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform syntax repairs for the buggy programs; subsequently, the resulting syntactically-fixed programs are repaired using constraint-based techniques to ensure functional correctness. The RNNs are trained using a corpus of syntactically correct submissions for a given programming assignment, and are then queried to fix syntax errors in an incorrect programming submission by replacing or inserting the predicted tokens at the error location.

Writing error specifications manually is time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, automatic inferring the error specification from API usage code is preferred.

It not only enables to statically analyze the robustness of a DNN model against the input as a whole, but also allows to identify the vulnerable segments of a sequential input (e.g. audio input) by runtime analysis.

We assess code2vec on a new dataset with more realistic settings. Our evaluation results suggest that although switching to new dataset does not significantly influence the performance, more realistic settings do significantly reduce the performance of code2vec. Further analysis on the successfully recommended method names also reveals the following findings: 1) around half (48.3%) of the accepted recommendations are made on getter/setter methods; 2) a large portion (19.2%) of the successfully recommended method names could be copied from the given bodies. To further validate its usefulness, we ask developers to manually score the difficulty in naming methods they developed.

Manually resolving fully qualified names (FQN) of API elements is a non-trivial task.

When creating a PR, developers can add a free-form description to describe what changes are made in this PR and/or why. Such a description is helpful for reviewers and other developers to gain a quick understanding of the PR without touching the details and may reduce the possibility of the PR being ignored or rejected. However, developers sometimes neglect to write descriptions for PRs. For example, in our collected dataset with over 333K PRs, more than 34% of the PR descriptions are empty. To alleviate this problem, we propose an approach to automatically generate PR descriptions based on the commit messages and the added source code comments in the PRs. We regard this problem as a text summarization problem and solve it using a novel sequence-to-sequence model. To cope with out-of-vocabulary words in software artifacts and bridge the gap between the training loss function of the sequence-to-sequence model and the evaluation metric ROUGE, which has been shown to correspond to human evaluation, we integrate the pointer generator and directly optimize for ROUGE using reinforcement learning and a special loss function.

A variety of DL frameworks and platforms play a key role to catalyze such progress. However, the differences in architecture designs and implementations of existing frameworks and platforms bring new challenges for DL software development and deployment. Till now, there is no study on how various mainstream frameworks and platforms influence both DL software development and deployment in practice. To fill this gap, we take the first step towards understanding how the most widely-used DL frameworks and platforms support the DL software development and deployment. We conduct a systematic study on these frameworks and platforms by using two types of DNN architectures and three popular datasets. (1) For development process, we investigate the prediction accuracy under the same runtime training configuration or same model weights/biases. We also study the adversarial robustness of trained models by leveraging the existing adversarial attack techniques. The experimental results show that the computing differences across frameworks could result in an obvious prediction accuracy decline, which should draw the attention of DL developers. (2) For deployment process, we investigate the prediction accuracy and performance (refers to time cost and memory consumption) when the trained models are migrated/quantized from PC to real mobile devices and web browsers. The DL platform study unveils that the migration and quantization still suffer from compatibility and reliability issues. Meanwhile, we find several DL software bugs by using the results as a benchmark. We further validate the results through bug confirmation from stakeholders and industrial positive feedback to highlight the implications of our study.

Each of these techniques, however, face inherent challenges, such as insufficient capability when handling memory aliases. Recent works have used hypothesis testing to address this drawback, albeit with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new deep neural architecture, which could significantly improve memory alias resolution. At the high level, our approach employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the binary code pattern pertaining to memory accesses. It then infers the memory region accessed by memory references. Since memory references to different regions naturally indicate a non-alias relationship, our neural architecture can greatly reduce the burden of doing hypothesis testing to track down non-alias relation in binary code. Different from previous researches that have utilized deep learning for other binary analysis tasks, the neural network proposed in this work is fundamentally novel. Instead of simply using off-the-shelf neural networks, we designed a new recurrent neural architecture that could capture the data dependency between machine code segments. To demonstrate the utility of our deep neural architecture, we implement it as RENN, a neural network-assisted reverse execution system. We utilize this tool to analyze software crashes corresponding to 40 memory corruption vulnerabilities from the real world. Our experiments show that RENN can significantly improve the efficiency of locating the root cause for the crashes. Compared to a state-of-the-art technique, RENN has 36.25% faster execution time on average, detects an average of 21.35% more non-alias pairs, and successfully identified the root cause of 12.5% more cases.',0,'Reverse Execution, Deep Learning, Memory Alias',50,'','RENN: Efficient Reverse Execution with Neural-Network-Assisted Alias Analysis'),(7593,'Automated test generation and evaluation in simulation environments is a key technology for verification of automated driving (AD) applications.

Traditional code coverage criteria are, however, designed for sequential programs and thus ineffective for concurrent programs. In this work, we introduce a novel code coverage criterion for testing thread-safe classes called MAP-coverage (short for memory-access patterns). The motivation is that concurrency bugs are often correlated with certain memory-access patterns, and thus it is desirable to comprehensively cover all memory-access patterns. Furthermore, we propose a testing method for maximizing MAP-coverage. Our method has been implemented as a self-contained toolkit, and the experimental results on 20 benchmark programs show that our toolkit outperforms existing testing methods.

The inconsistencies may be prevalent especially for structured inputs, commonly specified using string-based data types. Our study on defects reported over popular libraries reveals that such gaps may not be limited to input validation checks. We propose a test generation technique for structured string inputs where we infer inconsistencies in input definition to expose semantic gaps in the method under test and the method specification. We assess this technique using our tool SEGATE, Semantic Gap Tester. SEGATE uses static analysis and automaton modeling to infer the gap and generate test cases.

Even though different approaches have been proposed to mitigate the state space explosion problem, DSE still needs to represent a multitude of states in parallel to analyse them. If too many states are present, they cannot fit into memory, and DSE needs to terminate them prematurely or store them on disc intermediately.

Reproducing executions of mobile apps, in particular, has proven difficult under real-life scenarios due to multiple sources of external inputs and interactive nature of the apps. Previous works that provide record/replay functionality for mobile apps are restricted to particular input sources (e.g., touchscreen events) and present deployment challenges due to intrusive modifications to the underlying software stack. Moreover, due to their reliance on record and replay of device specific events, the recorded executions cannot be reliably reproduced across different platforms. In this paper, we present a new practical approach, RandR, for record and replay of Android applications. RandR captures and replays multiple sources of input (i.e., UI and network) without requiring source code (OS or app), administrative device privileges, or any special platform support. RandR achieves these qualities by instrumenting a select set of methods at runtime within an application\'s own sandbox. In addition, to enable portability of recorded executions across different platforms for replay, RandR contextualizes UI events as interactions with particular UI components (e.g., a button) as opposed to relying on platform specific features (e.g., screen coordinates). We demonstrate RandR\'s accurate cross-platform record and replay capabilities using over 30 real-world Android apps across a variety of platforms including emulators as well as commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices deployed in real life.',0,'Record;Replay;Android;Testing;Tools;Mobile Systems;Automation',40,'','RANDR: Record and Replay for Android Applications via Targeted Runtime Instrumentation'),(7818,'The IFDS algorithm can be compute-and memoryintensive for some large programs, often running for a long time (more than expected) or terminating prematurely after some time and/or memory budgets have been exhausted.

To improve this, we introduce a sparse alternative to the traditional IFDS algorithm. Instead of propagating the data-flow facts across all the program points along the program’s (interprocedural) control flow graph, we propagate every data-flow fact directly to its next possible use points along its own sparse control flow graph constructed on the fly, thus reducing significantly both the time and memory requirements incurred by the traditional IFDS algorithm.

For the time budget (5 hours) and memory budget (220GB) allocated per app, SPARSEDROID can run every app to completion but FLOWDROID terminates prematurely for 9 apps, resulting in an average speedup of 22.0x. This implies that when used as a market-level vetting tool, SPARSEDROID can finish analyzing these 40 apps in 2.13 hours (by issuing 228 leak warnings) while FLOWDROID manages to analyze only 30 apps in the same time period (by issuing only 147 leak warnings).',0,'IFDS, data-flow analysis, taint analysis',51,'','Performance-Boosting Sparsification of the IFDS Algorithm with Applications to Taint Analysis'),(7840,'A popular recommendation to programmers in object-oriented software is to \"program to an interface, not an implementation\" (PTI).

We implemented our technique for the Coq proof assistant in a tool dubbed mCoq. mCoq applies a set of mutation operators to Coq definitions of functions and datatypes, inspired by operators previously proposed for functional programming languages. mCoq then checks proofs of lemmas affected by operator application. To make our technique feasible in practice, we implemented several optimizations in mCoq such as parallel proof checking. We applied mCoq to several medium and large scale Coq projects, and recorded whether proofs passed or failed when applying different mutation operators. We then qualitatively analyzed the mutants, finding many instances of incomplete specifications. For our evaluation, we made several improvements to serialization of Coq files and even discovered a notable bug in Coq itself, all acknowledged by developers.

The accuracy of such models often suffers when the number of available samples is small, a thorny challenge under a given tuning-time constraint.

The intuition behind APPTESTMIGRATOR is that many apps share similarities in their functionality, and these similarities often result in conceptually similar user interfaces (through which that functionality is accessed). APPTESTMIGRATOR leverages these commonalities between user interfaces to migrate existing tests written for an app to another similar app. Specifically, given (1) a test case for an app (source app) and (2) a second app (target app), APPTESTMIGRATOR attempts to automatically transform the sequence of events and oracles in the test for the source app to events and oracles for the target app. We implemented APPTESTMIGRATOR for Android mobile apps and evaluated it on a set of randomly selected apps from the Google Play Store in four different categories.

HiCOND first infers the range for each option in a test configuration where bug-revealing test programs are more likely to be generated based on historical data. Then, it identifies a set of test configurations that can lead to diverse test programs through a search method (particle swarm optimization).

First, it uses taint analysis to soundly identify flows of sensitive data in the program and uses code instrumentation to annotate data before feeding them to the compressor. Second, it enhances the compressor to exploit the freedom to not compress of standard compression protocols, thus removing the dependency between sensitive data and the size of the compressor\'s output.

In general, maintaining a one-to-one relation is not always possible, especially in the presence of non-linear constraints.

Most are not actively maintained, allowing for drift between the most recent possible configuration and the code snippet as the snippet becomes out-of-date over time. Recent work has identified the problem of validating and detecting out-of-date code snippets as the most important consideration for code reuse. However, determining if a snippet is correct, but simply out-of-date, is a non-trivial task. In the best case, breaking changes are well documented, allowing developers to manually determine when a code snippet contains an out-of-date API usage. In the worst case, determining if and when a breaking change was made requires an exhaustive search through previous dependency versions. We present V2, a strategy for determining if a code snippet is out-of-date by detecting discrete instances of configuration drift, where the snippet uses an API which has since undergone a breaking change. Each instance of configuration drift is classified by a failure encountered during validation and a configuration patch, consisting of dependency version changes, which fixes the underlying fault. V2 uses feedback-directed search to explore the possible configuration space for a code snippet, reducing the number of potential environment configurations that need to be validated.

Developers are largely unaware of these flaws or the accumulating debt as they are focused on their immediate tasks of address individual issues. As a consequence, the cumulative impacts of their activities, as they affect the architecture, go unnoticed. To detect these problems early and prevent them from accumulating into severe ones we propose to monitor software evolution by tracking the interactions among files revised to address issues. In particular, we propose and show how we can automatically detect active hotspots, to reveal architecture problems. We have studied hundreds of hotspots along the evolution timelines of 21 open source projects and showed that there exist just a few dominating active hotspots per project at any given time. Moreover, these dominating active hotspots persist over long time periods, and thus deserve special attention.

However, reading a large number of user reviews every day is not an easy task for developers. Thus, there is a need for more automation to help developers respond to user reviews. Addressing the aforementioned need, in this work we propose a novel approach RRGen that automatically generates review responses by learning knowledge relations between reviews and their responses. RRGen explicitly incorporates review attributes, such as user rating and review length, and learns the relations between reviews and corresponding responses in a supervised way from the available training data. Experiments on 58 apps and 309,246 review-response pairs highlight that RRGen outperforms the baselines by at least 67.4% in terms of BLEU-4 (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate dialogue response generation systems).

This is an incomplete foundation. Generalizing existing research depends on validating two hypotheses: (1) Various regex extraction methodologies yield similar results, and (2) Regex characteristics are similar across programming languages.

Practitioners may capture user behaviour at different levels of granularity. A coarse-grained load test may miss detailed user behaviour, leading to a non-representative load test; while an extremely fine-grained load test would simply replay user actions step by step, leading to load tests that are costly to develop, execute and maintain. Workload recovery is at core of these load tests. Prior research often captures the workload as the frequency of user actions. However, there exists much valuable information in the context and sequences of user actions. Such richer information would ensure that the load tests that leverage such workloads are more field-representative. In this experience paper, we study the use of different granularities of user behaviour, i.e., basic user actions, basic user actions with contextual information and user action sequences with contextual information, when recovering workloads for use in the load testing of large-scale systems. We propose three approaches that are based on the three granularities of user behaviour and evaluate our approaches on four subject systems, namely Apache James, OpenMRS, Google Borg, and an ultra-large-scale industrial system (SA) from Alibaba.

First, the existing approaches only consider shallow features of source code such as method names and code tokens, but ignoring structured features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control-flow graphs (CFGs) of source code, which contains rich and well-defined semantics of source code.

Our key observation is that if the deep learning architecture of a DL model is trained over many different subsets of the original training dataset, the weights in the resultant reduced DL model (rDLM) can provide insights on the adjustment direction and magnitude of the weights in the original DL model to handle the test cases that the original DL model misclassifies. Apricot generates a set of such reduced DL models from the original DL model. In each iteration, for each failing test case experienced by the input DL model (iDLM), Apricot adjusts each weight of this iDLM toward the average weight of these rDLMs correctly classifying the test case and/or away from that of these rDLMs misclassifying the same test case, followed by training the weight-adjusted iDLM over the original training dataset to generate a new iDLM for the next iteration. The experiment using five state-of-the-art DL models shows that Apricot can increase the test accuracy of these models by 0.87%-1.55% with an average of 1.08%.

DeepStellar is generic to handle various RNN architectures, including LSTM and GRU, scalable to work on industrial-grade RNN models, and extensible to develop customized analyzers and tools. We demonstrated that, with DeepStellar, users are able to design efficient test generation tools, and develop effective adversarial sample detectors.

To meet this requirement efficiently, there have been many works on demand-driven analyses that perform only the work necessary to compute the points-to or alias information on the requested variables (queries). However, these demand-driven analyses can be very expensive when applied on large systems where the number of queries can be significant. Such a blow-up in analysis time is unacceptable in cases where scalability with real-time constraints is crucial; for example, when program analysis tools are plugged into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In this paper, we propose schemes to improve the scalability of demand-driven analyses without compromising on precision. Our work is based on novel ideas for eliminating irrelevant and redundant data-flow paths for the given queries. We introduce the idea of batch analysis, which can answer multiple given queries in batch mode. Batch analysis suits the environments with strict time constraints, where the queries come in batch. We present a batch alias analysis framework that can be used to speed up given demand-driven alias analysis. To show the effectiveness of this framework, we use two demand-driven alias analyses (1) the existing best performing demand-driven alias analysis tool for race-detection clients and (2) an optimized version thereof that avoids irrelevant computation. Our evaluations on a simulated data-race client, and on a recent program-understanding tool, show that batch analysis leads to significant performance gains, along with minor gains in precision.',0,'Batch analysis;Alias analysis;Points to Analysis',36,'','Batch Alias Analysis'),(8314,'Inferring program transformations from concrete program changes has many potential uses, such as applying systematic program edits, refactoring, and automated program repair. Existing work for inferring program transformations usually rely on statistical information over a potentially large set of program-change examples. However, in many practical scenarios we do not have such a large set of program-change examples. In this paper, we address the challenge of inferring a program transformation from one single example. Our core insight is that \"big code\" can provide effective guide for the generalization of a concrete change into a program transformation, i.e., code elements appearing in many files are general and should not be abstracted away. We first propose a framework for transformation inference, where programs are represented as hypergraphs to enable fine-grained generalization of transformations. We then design a transformation inference approach, GENPAT, that infers a program transformation based on code context and statistics from a big code corpus. We have evaluated GENPAT under two distinct application scenarios, systematic editing and program repair. The evaluation on systematic editing shows that GENPAT significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, SYDIT, with up to 5.5x correctly transformed cases. The evaluation on program repair suggests that GENPAT has the potential to be integrated in advanced program repair tools-GENPAT successfully repaired 19 real-world bugs in the Defects4J benchmark by simply applying transformations inferred from existing patches, where 4 bugs have never been repaired by any existing technique. Overall, the evaluation results suggest that GENPAT is effective for transformation inference and can potentially be adopted for many different applications.',1,'Pattern generation, Program adaptation, Code abstraction',63,'','Inferring Program Transformations From Singular Examples via Big Code'),(8320,'RESTful API documentation is expensive to produce and maintain due to the lack of reusable tools and automated solutions.

We collected a large data set of 2,841 Java projects, with 1.7 billion source lines of code (SLOC) at the latest revisions, 1.8 million code change revisions (0.4 million fixes), 6.2 million changed files, and 2.5 billion changed SLOCs. A change is considered repeated within or cross-project if it matches another change having occurred in the history of the project or another project, respectively. We report the following important findings. First, repetitiveness of changes could be as high as 70-100% at small sizes and decreases exponentially as size increases. Second, repetitiveness is higher and more stable in the cross-project setting than in the within-project one. Third, fixing changes repeat similarly to general changes.

SQLSynthesizer takes from users an example input and output of how the database should be queried, and then synthesizes a SQL query that reproduces the example output from the example input.

In this paper, we propose to generate loop-invariants automatically through learning and verification. Given a Hoare triple of a program containing a loop, we start with randomly testing the program, collect program states at run-time and categorize them based on whether they satisfy the invariant to be discovered. Next, classification techniques are employed to generate a candidate loop-invariant automatically. Afterwards, we refine the candidate through selective sampling so as to overcome the lack of sufficient test cases. Only after a candidate invariant cannot be improved further through selective sampling, we verify whether it can be used to prove the Hoare triple. If it cannot, the generated counterexamples are added as new tests and we repeat the above process. Furthermore, we show that by introducing a path-sensitive learning, i.e., partitioning the program states according to program locations they visit and classifying each partition separately, we are able to learn disjunctive loop-invariants.

Runtime monitoring approaches have thus been proposed to detect deviations from the expected behavior. They commonly rely on temporal logic or domain-specific languages to formally define requirements, which are then checked by analyzing the stream of monitored events and event data. Some approaches also allow developers to generate constraints from declarative specifications of the expected behavior. However, independent of the approach, deep domain knowledge is required to specify the desired behavior. This knowledge is often not accessible in SoS environments with multiple development teams independently working on different, heterogeneous systems. In this New Ideas Paper we thus describe an approach that automatically mines constraints for runtime monitoring from event logs recorded in SoS. Our approach builds on ideas from specification mining, process mining, and machine learning to mine different types of constraints on event occurrence, event timing, and event data.

In this paper we present an approach that allows performance self-adaptation using a system model based on queuing networks (QNs), a well-assessed formalism for software performance engineering. Software engineers can select the adaptation knobs of a QN (routing probabilities, service rates, and concurrency level) and we automatically derive a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation suitable to continuously configure the selected knobs and track the desired performance requirements. Previous MPC approaches have two main limitations: i) high computational cost of the optimization, due to nonlinearity of the models; ii) focus on long-run performance metrics only, due to the lack of tractable representations of the QN\'s time-course evolution. As a consequence, these limitations allow adaptations with coarse time granularities, neglecting the system\'s transient behavior. Our MPC adaptation strategy is efficient since it is based on mixed integer programming, which uses a compact representation of a QN with ordinary differential equations.

We propose an approach to detect five different code smells, namely Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance, Blob, and Feature Envy, by exploiting change history information mined from versioning systems. We applied approach, coined as HIST (Historical Information for Smell deTection), to eight software projects written in Java, and wherever possible compared with existing state-of-the-art smell detectors based on source code analysis. The results indicate that HIST\'s precision ranges between 61% and 80%, and its recall ranges between 61% and 100%. More importantly, the results confirm that HIST is able to identify code smells that cannot be identified through approaches solely based on code analysis.',83,'Code Smells;Change History Information',31,'History;Feature extraction;Surgery;Association rules;Detectors;Measurement,fault tolerant computing;software maintenance;software management;source code (software),bad smells detection;change history information;code smells;fault proneness;code elements;structural information;divergent change;shotgun surgery;parallel inheritance;blob;feature envy;versioning systems;HIST;Historical Information for Smell deTection;software projects;Java;smell detectors;source code analysis','Detecting bad smells in source code using change history information'),(8707,'In recent years, malware (malicious software) has greatly evolved and has become very sophisticated. The evolution of malware makes it difficult to detect using traditional signature-based malware detectors. Thus, researchers have proposed various behavior-based malware detection techniques to mitigate this problem. However, there are still serious shortcomings, related to scalability and computational complexity, in existing malware behavior modeling techniques. This raises questions about the practical applicability of these techniques. This paper proposes and evaluates a bounded feature space behavior modeling (BOFM) framework for scalable malware detection. BOFM models the interactions between software (which can be malware or benign) and security-critical OS resources in a scalable manner. Information collected at run-time according to this model is then used by machine learning algorithms to learn how to accurately classify software as malware or benign. One of the key problems with simple malware behavior modeling (e.g., n-gram model) is that the number of malware features (i.e., signatures) grows proportional to the size of execution traces, with a resulting malware feature space that is so large that it makes the detection process very challenging. On the other hand, in BOFM, the malware feature space is bounded by an upper limit N, a constant, and the results of our experiments show that its computation time and memory usage are vastly lower than in currently reported, malware detection techniques, while preserving or even improving their high detection accuracy.',9,'Malware detection;Malware behavior modeling',32,'Malware;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;File systems;Scalability;Instruction sets,computational complexity;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);operating systems (computers);pattern classification,scalable malware detection techniques;bounded feature space behavior modeling;malicious software;signature-based malware detectors;behavior-based malware detection techniques;computational complexity;malware behavior modeling techniques;BOFM framework;security-critical OS resources;machine learning algorithms;software classification;execution trace size;malware feature space','A scalable approach for malware detection through bounded feature space behavior modeling'),(8719,'Reducing the test input given to a program while preserving some property of interest is important, e.g., to localize faults or to reduce test suites. The well-known delta debugging algorithm and its derivatives automate this task by repeatedly reducing a given input.

This paper presents the Generalized Tree Reduction (GTR) algorithm, an effective and efficient technique to reduce arbitrary test inputs that can be represented as a tree, such as program code, PDF files, and XML documents. The algorithm combines tree transformations with delta debugging and a greedy backtracking algorithm. To reduce the size of the considered search space, the approach automatically specializes the tree transformations applied by the algorithm based on examples of input trees. We evaluate GTR by reducing Python files that cause interpreter crashes, JavaScript files that cause browser inconsistencies, PDF documents with malicious content, and XML files used to tests an XML validator.

To help developers focus their attention to those files is crucial. Several existing automated approaches for bug localization from a bug report face a key challenge, called lexical mismatch, in which the terms used in bug reports to describe a bug are different from the terms and code tokens used in source files. This paper presents a novel approach that uses deep neural network (DNN) in combination with rVSM, an information retrieval (IR) technique. rVSM collects the feature on the textual similarity between bug reports and source files. DNN is used to learn to relate the terms in bug reports to potentially different code tokens and terms in source files and documentation if they appear frequently enough in the pairs of reports and buggy files. Our empirical evaluation on real-world projects shows that DNN and IR complement well to each other to achieve higher bug localization accuracy than individual models.

Correctness in such an API is difficult to reason about manually, and testing against reference solutions is equally difficult as reference solutions implement an unknown set of allowed behaviors, and programmers have no way to directly control API internals to expose or reproduce errors. This paper provides a way to encode an MCAPI execution as a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem, which if satisfiable, yields a feasible execution schedule on the same trace, such that it resolves non-determinism in the MCAPI runtime in a way that it now fails user provided assertions. The paper proves the problem is NP-complete. The encoding is useful for test, debug, and verification of MCAPI program execution. The novelty in the encoding is the direct use of match pairs (potential send and receive couplings). Match-pair encoding for MCAPI executions, when compared to other encoding strategies, is simpler to reason about, results in significantly fewer terms in the SMT problem, and captures feasible behaviors that are ignored in previously published techniques. Further, to our knowledge, this is the first SMT encoding that is able to run in infinite-buffer semantics, meaning the runtime has unlimited internal buffering as opposed to no internal buffering. Results demonstrate that the SMT encoding, restricted to zero-buffer semantics, uses fewer clauses when compared to another zero-buffer technique, and it runs faster and uses less memory.

Some test faults are similar to those found in application code, while others are more subtle, caused by incorrect implementation of testing concepts and processes. These faults may cause a test to fail when it should not, or allow program faults to go undetected. In this work we explore whether lightweight static analyses can be cost-effective in pinpointing patterns associated with faults tests. Our exploration includes a categorization and explanation of test patterns, and their application to 12 open source projects that include over 40K tests. We found that several patterns, detectable through simple and efficient static analyses of just the test code, can detect faults with a low false positive rate, while other patterns would require a more sophisticated and extensive code analysis to be useful.',1,'coding patterns;lightweight static analysis;test faults',21,'Software;Testing;Encoding;Syntactics;Dynamic scheduling;Fault diagnosis;Detectors,program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;source code (software),test analysis;test faults;application code;program faults;static analyses','Test Analysis: Searching for Faults in Tests (N)'),(9135,'In the current online advertisement delivery, an ad slot on a publisher\'s website may go through multiple layers of bidding and reselling until the final ad content is delivered. The publishers have little control on the ads being displayed on their web pages. As a result, website visitors may suffer from unwanted ads such as malvertising, intrusive ads, and information disclosure ads. Unfortunately, the visitors often blame the publisher for their unpleasant experience and switch to competitor websites. In this paper, we propose a novel programming support system for ad delivery, called PAD, for publisher programmers, who specify their policies on regulating third-party ads shown on their websites. PAD features an expressive specification language and a novel persistent policy enforcement runtime that can self-install and self-protect throughout the entire ad delegation chain. It also provides an ad-specific memory protection scheme that prevents malvertising by corrupting malicious payloads. Our experiments show that PAD has negligible runtime overhead.

This paper presents a learning to share approach that enables the incorporation of more nuanced privacy controls into OSNs. Specifically, we propose a reusable, adaptive software architecture that uses rigorous runtime analysis to help OSN users to make informed decisions about suitable audiences for their posts.

However, searching in this manner is not ideal, because just using keywords places limits on what developers can express as well as the overall interaction that is required. Based on the observation that the results from one query create a con-text in which a next is formulated, we present CodeExchange, a new code search engine that we developed to explicitly leverage this context to support fluid, expressive reformulation of queries.

The former is often inadequate as finite-state automata lack expressiveness in capturing behaviors of data-rich programs, whereas the latter is often not scalable. In this work, we propose a fully automated approach to learn stateful typestates by extending the classic active learning process to generate transition guards (i.e., propositions on data states).

Given a faulty program and a fault-exposing test suite, ssFix does fault localization to identify suspicious statements that are likely to be faulty. For each such statement, ssFix identifies a code chunk (or target chunk) including the statement and its local context. ssFix works on the target chunk to produce patches. To do so, it first performs syntactic code search to find candidate code chunks that are syntax-related, i.e., structurally similar and conceptually related, to the target chunk from a code database (or codebase) consisting of the local faulty program and an external code repository. ssFix assumes the correct fix to be contained in the candidate chunks, and it leverages each candidate chunk to produce patches for the target chunk. To do so, ssFix translates the candidate chunk by unifying the names used in the candidate chunk with those in the target chunk; matches the chunk components (expressions and statements) between the translated candidate chunk and the target chunk; and produces patches for the target chunk based on the syntactic differences that exist between the matched components and in the unmatched components. ssFix finally validates the patched programs generated against the test suite and reports the first one that passes the test suite.

In this paper, we address this challenge for recommendation systems that are based on evolutionary coupling. Such systems use targeted association-rule mining to identify relevant patterns in a software system\'s change history. Traditionally, this process involves ranking artifacts using interestingness measures such as confidence and support.

Using system testing techniques, developers can expose problems that escaped the previous quality assurance activities and have a last chance to fix bugs before releasing the system in production. System testing of cloud-based systems accounts for a series of complex and time demanding activities, from the deployment and configuration of the elastic system, to the execution of synthetic clients, and the collection and persistence of execution data.

This runtime interaction between JavaScript and the DOM is error-prone and challenging to test. In order to unit test a JavaScript function that has read/write DOM operations, a DOM instance has to be provided as a test fixture. This DOM fixture needs to be in the exact structure expected by the function under test. Otherwise, the test case can terminate prematurely due to a null exception. Generating these fixtures is challenging due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript and the hierarchical structure of the DOM.

By far, recognizing similar components in binary code remains a challenge. Existing research employs either static or dynamic approaches to capture program syntax or semantics-level features for comparison. However, there exist multiple design limitations in previous work, which result in relatively high cost, low accuracy and scalability, and thus severely impede their practical use. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages in-memory fuzzing for binary code similarity analysis. Our prototype tool IMF-SIM applies in-memory fuzzing to launch analysis towards every function and collect traces of different kinds of program behaviors. The similarity score of two behavior traces is computed according to their longest common subsequence. To compare two functions, a feature vector is generated, whose elements are the similarity scores of the behavior trace-level comparisons. We train a machine learning model through labeled feature vectors; later, for a given feature vector by comparing two functions, the trained model gives a final score, representing the similarity score of the two functions. We evaluate IMF-SIM against binaries compiled by different compilers, optimizations, and commonly-used obfuscation methods, in total over one thousand binary executables.

The approach resembles dynamic-symbolic (a.k.a. “concolic”) execution in a conventional programming language, adapted to the unique features of the dataflow domain. In third-party benchmarks, SEDGE achieves higher coverage than past techniques for 5 out of 20 PigMix benchmarks and 7 out of 11 SDSS benchmarks and (with equal coverage for the rest of the benchmarks). We also show that our targeting of the high-level dataflow language pays off: for complex programs, state-of-the-art dynamic-symbolic execution at the level of the generated map-reduce code (instead of the original dataflow program) requires many more test cases or achieves much lower coverage than our approach.',5,'',26,'Concrete;Cognition;Benchmark testing;Programming;Educational institutions;Data processing;Extraterrestrial measurements,data flow analysis;program testing;programming languages;reasoning about programs;specification languages,symbolic example data generation;dataflow programs;automatic testing;mapreduce programs;pig platform;Hadoop map-reduce programs;operator use;SEDGE system;dataflow operator;symbolic constraints;symbolic reasoning engine;SMT solver;concolic execution;conventional programming language;dataflow domain;SDSS benchmarks;high-level dataflow language;complex programs;state-of-the-art dynamic-symbolic execution;map-reduce code;test cases','SEDGE: Symbolic example data generation for dataflow programs'),(9780,'At present, bots are still in their preliminary stages of development.

Moreover, bots will derive immeasurable value by programming them to invoke APIs for their results. Today, within the Web and Mobile development community, complex applications are being stringed together with a few lines of code - all made possible by APIs. Yet, developers today are not as empowered to program bots in much the same way. To overcome this, we introduce BotBase, a bot programming platform that dynamically synthesizes natural language user expressions into API invocations.

Each of these platforms uses a different programming environment, each with its own language and APIs for app development. Small app development teams lack the resources and the expertise to build and maintain separate code bases of the app customized for each platform. As a result, we are beginning to see a number of cross-platform mobile app development frameworks. These frameworks allow the app developers to specify the business logic of the app once, using the language and APIs of a home platform (e.g., Windows Phone), and automatically produce versions of the app for multiple target platforms (e.g., iOS and Android). In this paper, we focus on the problem of testing cross-platform app development frameworks. Such frameworks are challenging to develop because they must correctly translate the home platform API to the (possibly disparate) target platform API while providing the same behavior. We develop a differential testing methodology to identify inconsistencies in the way that these frameworks handle the APIs of the home and target platforms. We have built a prototype testing tool, called X-Checker, and have applied it to test Xamarin, a popular framework that allows Windows Phone apps to be cross-compiled into native Android (and iOS) apps.

Symbolic execution tools, like CREST, KLEE, FuzzBALL, and Symbolic PathFinder, have enabled researchers and practitioners to experiment with new ideas, scale the technique to larger applications and apply it to new application domains. Therefore, the correctness of these tools is of critical importance. In this paper, we present our experience extending compiler testing techniques to find errors in both the concrete and symbolic execution components of symbolic execution engines. The approach used relies on a novel way to create program versions, in three different testing modes-concrete, single-path and multi-path-each exercising different features of symbolic execution engines. When combined with existing program generation techniques and appropriate oracles, this approach enables differential testing within a single symbolic execution engine. We have applied our approach to the KLEE, CREST and FuzzBALL symbolic execution engines, where it has discovered 20 different bugs exposing a variety of important errors having to do with the handling of structures, division, modulo, casting, vector instructions and more, as well as issues related to constraint solving, compiler optimisations and test input replay.',1,'',34,'Testing;Engines;Tools;Computer bugs;Concrete;Program processors;Instruments,optimising compilers;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification,differential testing;single symbolic execution engine;test input replay;automatic testing;software testing;Symbolic PathFinder;symbolic execution components;symbolic execution tools;program generation techniques;compiler testing techniques;concrete testing mode;single-path testing mode;multipath testing mode;KLEE execution engine;CREST symbolic execution engine;FuzzBALL symbolic execution engine;compiler optimisations;constraint solving','Automatic testing of symbolic execution engines via program generation and differential testing'),(10217,'System configuration languages provide powerful abstractions that simplify managing large-scale, networked systems. Thousands of organizations now use configuration languages, such as Puppet. However, specifications written in configuration languages can have bugs and the shell remains the simplest way to debug a misconfigured system. Unfortunately, it is unsafe to use the shell to fix problems when a system configuration language is in use: a fix applied from the shell may cause the system to drift from the state specified by the configuration language. Thus, despite their advantages, configuration languages force system administrators to give up the simplicity and familiarity of the shell. This paper presents a synthesis-based technique that allows administrators to use configuration languages and the shell in harmony. Administrators can fix errors using the shell and the technique automatically repairs the higher-level specification written in the configuration language. The approach (1) produces repairs that are consistent with the fix made using the shell; (2) produces repairs that are maintainable by minimizing edits made to the original specification; (3) ranks and presents multiple repairs when relevant; and (4) supports all shells the administrator may wish to use.

However, when one wants to mimic a real user for evaluating usability, or when it is necessary to extensively test important end-user tasks of a system, or to generate examples of how to use an interface, this generation approach fails.

However, to meet application specific requirements, the frameworks need to be customized via extension points. This is often done by passing a framework related object as an argument to an API call. To enable such customizations, the object can be created by extending a framework class, implementing an interface, or changing the properties of the object via API calls. However, it is both a common and non-trivial task to find all the details related to the customizations.

These summarized dataflows are computed at a fine-grained instruction level; the result of which, we call “dynamic dependence summaries.” Although static summaries have been proposed, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first technique for dynamic dependence summaries. The benefits to efficiency of such summarization may be afforded with losses of accuracy. As such, we evaluate the degree of accuracy loss and the degree of efficiency gain when using dynamic dependence summaries of library methods.

Selective mutation testing is a well-studied technique to reduce this cost by selecting a subset of all mutants, which would otherwise have to be considered in their entirety. Two common approaches are operator-based mutant selection, which only generates mutants using a subset of mutation operators, and random mutant selection, which selects a subset of mutants generated using all mutation operators. While each of the two approaches provides some reduction in the number of mutants to execute, applying either of the two to medium-sized, real-world programs can still generate a huge number of mutants, which makes their execution too expensive.

Although many such tools are powerful, they typically need complete programs where all the code names (e.g., class names, method names) are resolved. In many scenarios, researchers have to analyze partial programs in bug fixes (the revised source files can be viewed as a partial program), tutorials, and code search results. As a partial program is a subset of a complete program, many code names in partial programs are unknown. As a result, despite their syntactical correctness, existing complete-code tools cannot analyze partial programs, and existing partial-code tools are limited in both their number and analysis capability. Instead of proposing another tool for analyzing partial programs, we propose a general approach, called GRAPA, that boosts existing tools for complete programs to analyze partial programs. Our major insight is that after unknown code names are resolved, tools for complete programs can analyze partial programs with minor modifications. In particular, GRAPA locates Java archive files to resolve unknown code names, and resolves the remaining unknown code names from resolved code names. To illustrate GRAPA, we implement a tool that leverages the state-of-the-art tool, WALA, to analyze Java partial programs. We thus implemented the first tool that is able to build system dependency graphs for partial programs, complementing existing tools.

A key limitation is the use of sequences in phrase-based SMT to model and translate source code with well-formed structures. We propose mppSMT, a divide-and-conquer technique to address that with novel training and migration algorithms using phrase-based SMT in three phases. First, mppSMT treats a program as a sequence of syntactic units and maps/translates such sequences in two languages to one another. Second, with a syntax-directed fashion, it deals with the tokens within syntactic units by encoding them with semantic symbols to represent their data and token types. This encoding via semantic symbols helps better migration of API usages. Third, the lexical tokens corresponding to each sememe are mapped or migrated. The resulting sequences of tokens are merged together to form the final migrated code. Such divide-and-conquer and syntax-direction strategies enable phrase-based SMT to adapt well to syntactical structures in source code, thus, improving migration accuracy.

We observe that copy-paste-modify can be substantially faster to use than manual abstraction, and past research strongly suggests that it is a popular technique among software developers.

Analysis shows that the disparity between probabilities can be large for programs that encounter a large number of events during execution. Because sets of ordered event pairs define conditions for discovering concurrency bugs, this disparity can make some concurrency bugs highly unlikely. The complementary nature of the two possible orders also indicates a potential trade-off between the probability of discovering frequently-occurring and infrequently-occurring concurrency bugs. To help address this trade-off in a more balanced way, randomized-stride scheduling is proposed, where scheduling granularity for each thread is adjusted using a randomized stride calculated based on thread length. With some assumptions, strides can be calculated to allow covering the least likely event pair orders.

The result is usually long, rather unreadable code that needs to be re-written or re-tuned with every platform upgrade.

In this work, we present SOFIA, a Security Oracle for SQL-Injection Vulnerabilities. SOFIA is programming-language and source-code independent, and can be used with various attack generation tools. Moreover, because it does not rely on known attacks for learning, SOFIA is meant to also detect types of SQLi attacks that might be unknown at learning time. The oracle challenge is recast as a one-class classification problem where we learn to characterise legitimate SQL statements to accurately distinguish them from SQLi attack statements. We have carried out an experimental validation on six applications, among which two are large and widely-used. SOFIA was used to detect real SQLi vulnerabilities with inputs generated by three attack generation tools.

Most existing approaches towards this problem utilized supervised machine learning techniques, which often require users to manually label a large amount of training data. Such process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, reducing the onerous burden of manual labeling while still being able to achieve good performance is crucial. Active learning is one potential technique to address this challenge, which aims at training a good classifier with as few labeled data as possible. Nevertheless, our observation on real industrial data reveals that existing active learning approaches generate poor and unstable performances on crowdsourced testing data. We analyze the deep reason and find that the dataset has significant local biases. To address the above problems, we propose LOcal-based Active ClassiFication (LOAF) to classify true fault from crowdsourced test reports. LOAF recommends a small portion of instances which are most informative within local neighborhood, and asks user their labels, then learns classifiers based on local neighborhood.

In this paper, we apply a combinatorial test data generation approach to two real-world ETL applications at Medidata.

Next, the IDMs are used to create test data sets that achieve t-way coverage, which has shown to be very effective in detecting software faults. The generated test data sets also satisfy all the constraints identified in the first step. To avoid creating IDMs from scratch when there is a change to the original data source or constraints, our approach extends the original IDMs with additional information. The new IDMs, which we refer to as Adaptive IDMs (AIDMs), are updated by comparing the changes against the additional information, and are then used to generate new test data sets. We implement our approach in a tool, called comBinatorial big daTa Test dAta Generator (BIT-TAG). Our experience shows that combinatorial testing can be effectively applied to big data applications.

In general, the quality of such recommendations is affected by (1) the values selected for various parameters of the mining algorithm, (2) characteristics of the set of changes used to derive a recommendation, and (3) characteristics of the system\'s change history for which recommendations are generated. In this paper, we empirically investigate the extent to which certain choices for these factors affect change recommendation. Specifically, we conduct a series of systematic experiments on the change histories of two large industrial systems and eight large open source systems, in which we control the size of the change set for which to derive a recommendation, the measure used to assess the strength of the evolutionary coupling, and the maximum size of historical changes taken into account when inferring these couplings. We use the results from our study to derive a number of practical guidelines for applying association rule mining for change recommendation.',0,'Evolutionary coupling;association rule mining;parameter tuning;change recommendations;change impact analysis',41,'Couplings;History;Data mining;Software;Algorithm design and analysis;Guidelines;Size measurement,data mining;recommender systems;unsupervised learning,change recommendation;association rule mining;unsupervised learning technique;evolutionary coupling;recommendation quality;open source systems','Practical guidelines for change recommendation using association rule mining'),(10957,'In this paper, we show an end-user oriented tool suite for mobile application development.

Establishing traceability links is a challenging and cost-intensive task, which is uneconomical without suitable strategies for maintaining high link quality. Current approaches to Traceability Management (TM), however, often make important assumptions and choices without ensuring that the consequences and implications for trace-ability maintenance are feasible and desirable in practice. In this paper, therefore, we identify a set of core factors that influence how the quality of traceability links can be maintained. For each factor, we discuss relevant challenges and provide guidelines on how best to ensure viable traceability maintenance in a practical TM approach.

Detailed reasoning about software behavior is often facilitated by program invariants that hold across all program executions. Finding program invariants is in fact an essential step in automated program verification. Automatic discovery of precise invariants, however, can be very difficult in practice. The problem can be simplified if one has access to a candidate set of assertions (or annotations) and the search for invariants is limited over the space defined by these annotations. Then, the main challenge is to automatically generate quality program annotations. We present an approach that infers program annotations automatically by leveraging the history of verifying related programs. Our algorithm extracts high-quality annotations from previous verification attempts, and then applies them for verifying new programs. We present a case study where we applied our algorithm to Microsoft\'s Static Driver Verifier (SDV).

Executing these large test suites is expensive, both in terms of time and energy. Cache misses are known to be one of the main factors contributing to execution time of a software. Cache misses are reduced by increasing the locality of memory references. For a single program run, compiler optimisations help improve data locality and code layout optimisations help improve spatial locality of instructions. Nevertheless, cache locality optimisations have not been proposed and explored across several program runs, which is the case when we run several test cases. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel approach to improve instruction locality across test case runs. Our approach measures the distance between test case runs (number of different instructions). We then permute the test cases for execution so that the distance between neighboring test cases is minimised. We hypothesize that test cases executed in this new order for improved instruction locality will reduce time consumed. We conduct a preliminary evaluation with four subject programs and test suites from the SIR repository to answer the following questions, 1. Is execution time of a test suite affected by the order in which test cases are executed? and 2. How does time consumed in executing our permutation compare to random test case permutations? We found that the order in which test cases are executed has a definite impact on execution time. The extent of impact varies, based on program characteristics and test cases. Our approach outperformed more than 97% of random test case permutations on 3 of the 4 subject programs and did better than 93% of the random orderings on the remaining subject program.

APR techniques, if effective and efficient, can greatly help software debugging and maintenance. Recently proposed APR techniques can be generally classified into two families, namely search-based and semantics-based APR methods. To produce repairs, search based APR techniques generate huge populations of possible repairs, i.e., search space, and lazily search for the best one among the search space. Semantics-based APR techniques utilize constraint solving and program synthesis to make search space more tractable, and find those repairs that conform to semantics constraints extracted via symbolic execution. Despite recent advances in APR, search-based APR still suffers from search space explosion problem, while the semantics-based APR could be hindered by limited capability of constraint solving and program synthesis. Furthermore, both APR families may be subject to overfitting, in which generated repairs do not generalize to other test sets. This thesis works towards enhancing both effectiveness and efficiency in order for APR to be practically adopted in foreseeable future. To achieve this goal, other than using test cases as the primary criteria for traversing the search space, we designed a new feature used for a new search-based APR technique to effectively traverse the search space, wherein bug fix history is used to evaluate the quality of repair candidates. We also developed a deductive-reasoning-based repair technique that combines search-based and semantics-based approaches to enhance the repair capability, while ensuring the soundness of generated repairs. We also leveraged machine-learning techniques to build a predictive model that predicts whether an APR technique is effective in fixing particular bugs. In the future, we plan to synergize many existing APR techniques, improve our predictive model, and adopt the advances of other fields such as test case generation and program synthesis for APR.',0,'Automatic Program Repair;Deductive Reasoning;Mining Software Repository;Genetic Programming',29,'Maintenance engineering;Computer bugs;History;Software;Semantics;Syntactics;Search problems,inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;semantic networks;software maintenance,automatic program repair;software engineering;software debugging;software maintenance;search-based APR method;semantics-based APR method;semantic constraint extraction;symbolic execution;deductive reasoning;machine learning;bug fixing','Towards efficient and effective automatic program repair'),(11119,'Runtime verification can be used to find bugs early, during software development, by monitoring test executions against formal specifications (specs).

In recent years, to alleviate this task, many text-based test-report classification and prioritization techniques have been proposed. However in the mobile testing domain, test reports often consist of more screenshots and shorter descriptive text, and thus text-based techniques may be ineffective or inapplicable. The shortage and ambiguity of natural-language text information and the well defined screenshots of activity views within mobile applications motivate our novel technique based on using image understanding for multi-objective test-report prioritization. In this paper, by taking the similarity of screenshots into consideration, we present a multi-objective optimization-based prioritization technique to assist inspections of crowdsourced test reports. In our technique, we employ the Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) technique to measure the similarity of the screenshots, and apply the natural-language processing technique to measure the distance between the text of test reports.

Among various techniques, we focus on model-based Android GUI testing that utilizes a GUI model for systematic test generation and effective debugging support. Since test inputs are generated based on the underlying model, accurate GUI modeling of an AUT is the most crucial factor in order to generate effective test inputs. However, most modern Android apps contain a number of dynamically constructed GUIs that make accurate behavior modeling more challenging. To address this problem, we propose a set of multi-level GUI Comparison Criteria (GUICC) that provides the selection of multiple abstraction levels for GUI model generation. By using multilevel GUICC, we conducted empirical experiments to identify the influence of GUICC on testing effectiveness. Results show that our approach, which performs model-based testing with multi-level GUICC, achieved higher effectiveness than activity-based GUI model generation.

We observe that bug inducing changes can facilitate the bug fixing process. For example, it helps triage the bug fixing task to the developers who committed the bug inducing changes or enables developers to fix bugs by reverting these changes. Our study further identifies that change logs and the naturally small granularity of changes can help boost the performance of IR-based bug localization. Motivated by these observations, we propose an IR-based approach Locus to locate bugs from software changes, and evaluate it on six large open source projects.

INSERT INTO `paper` VALUES (11181,'Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the standard language for styling web documents and is extensively used in the industry. However, CSS lacks constructs that would allow code reuse (e.g., functions). Consequently, maintaining CSS code is often a cumbersome and error-prone task.

Despite the clear maintainability benefits coming from the use of preprocessors, there is currently no support for migrating legacy CSS code to preprocessors. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically detecting duplicated style declarations in CSS code that can be migrated to preprocessor functions (i.e., mixins).

In an effort to understand what makes a program analyzer most attractive to developers, we mounted a multi-method investigation at Microsoft. Through interviews and surveys of developers as well as analysis of defect data, we provide insight and answers to four high level research questions that can help researchers design program analyzers meeting the needs of software developers. First, we explore what barriers hinder the adoption of program analyzers, like poorly expressed warning messages. Second, we shed light on what functionality developers want from analyzers, including the types of code issues that developers care about. Next, we answer what non-functional characteristics an analyzer should have to be widely used, how the analyzer should fit into the development process, and how its results should be reported.

They typically have many code snippets that implement similar functionalities, i.e., cross-language clones. Programmers often need to track and modify cross-language clones consistently to maintain similar functionalities across different language implementations. In literature, researchers have proposed approaches to detect cross-language clones, mostly for languages that share a common intermediate language (such as the .NET language family) so that techniques for detecting single-language clones can be applied. As a result, those approaches cannot detect cross-language clones for many projects that are not implemented in a .NET language. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, CLCMiner, that detects cross-language clones automatically without the need of an intermediate language. Our approach mines such clones from revision histories, which reflect how programmers maintain cross-language clones in practice. We have implemented a prototype tool for our approach and conducted an evaluation on five open source projects that have versions in Java and C#.

Unfortunately, the high runtime overhead imposed by dynamic taint analysis makes it impractical in many scenarios. The key obstacle is the strict coupling of program execution and taint tracking logic code. To alleviate this performance bottleneck, recent work seeks to offload taint analysis from program execution and run it on a spare core or a different CPU. However, since the taint analysis has heavy data and control dependencies on the program execution, the massive data in recording and transformation overshadow the benefit of decoupling. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to allow very lightweight logging, resulting in much lower execution slowdown, while still permitting us to perform full-featured offline taint analysis. We develop StraightTaint, a hybrid taint analysis tool that completely decouples the program execution and taint analysis. StraightTaint relies on very lightweight logging of the execution information to reconstruct a straight-line code, enabling an offline symbolic taint analysis without frequent data communication with the application. While StraightTaint does not log complete runtime or input values, it is able to precisely identify the causal relationships between sources and sinks, for example.

Existing randomized techniques are usually ineffective. PCT innovatively generates scheduling, before executing a program, based on priorities and priority change points. Hence, it provides a probabilistic guarantee to trigger concurrency bugs. PCT randomly selects priority change points among all events, which might be effective for non-deadlock concurrency bugs. However, deadlocks usually involve two or more threads and locks, and require more ordering constraints to be triggered. We interestingly observe that, every two events of a deadlock usually occur within a short range. We generally formulate this range as the bug Radius, to denote the max distance of every two events of a concurrency bug. Based on the bug radius, we propose RPro (Radius aware Probabilistic testing) for triggering deadlocks. Unlike PCT, RPro selects priority change points within the radius of the targeted deadlocks but not among all events. Hence, it guarantees larger probabilities to trigger deadlocks. We have implemented RPro and PCT and evaluated them on a set of real-world benchmarks containing 10 unique deadlocks. The experimental results show that RPro triggered all deadlocks with higher probabilities (i.e., >7.7x times larger on average) than that by PCT. We also evaluated RPro with radius varying from 1 to 150 (or 300). The result shows that the radius of a deadlock is much smaller (i.e., from 2 to 114 in our experiment) than the number of all events.

These rule-based approaches often rely on the highly frequent appearances of certain patterns in a project to infer rules. It is known that if a pattern does not appear frequently enough, rules are not learned, thus missing many bugs. In this paper, we propose a new approach - Bugram - that leverages n-gram language models instead of rules to detect bugs. Bugram models program tokens sequentially, using the n-gram language model. Token sequences from the program are then assessed according to their probability in the learned model, and low probability sequences are marked as potential bugs. The assumption is that low probability token sequences in a program are unusual, which may indicate bugs, bad practices, or unusual/special uses of code of which developers may want to be aware. We evaluate Bugram in two ways. First, we apply Bugram on the latest versions of 16 open source Java projects. Results show that Bugram detects 59 bugs, 42 of which are manually verified as correct, 25 of which are true bugs and 17 are code snippets that should be refactored. Among the 25 true bugs, 23 cannot be detected by PR-Miner. We have reported these bugs to developers, 7 of which have already been confirmed by developers (4 of them have already been fixed), while the rest await confirmation.

We apply Bugram on 14 Java projects evaluated in these three studies. Bugram detects 21 true bugs, at least 10 of which cannot be detected by these three tools.

However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embed-dings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word- and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required.

We juxtapose two different user interfaces of the interactive verifier KeY: the traditional one which focuses on proof objects and a more recent one that provides a view akin to an interactive debugger. We carefully designed a controlled experiment where users were given various proof understanding tasks that had to be solved with alternating interfaces. We provide statistical evidence that the conjectured higher effectivity of the debugger-like interface is not just a hunch.',0,'Verification;Proof Understanding;Empirical Evaluation',14,'User interfaces;Usability;Inspection;Standards;Java,interactive systems;program debugging;program verification;theorem proving;user interfaces,empirical evaluation;user interface;interactive program verifier;theorem prover;proof object;interactive debugger','An empirical evaluation of two user interfaces of an interactive program verifier'),(11277,'Software engineering is extremely information-intensive. Every day developers work with source code, version repositories, issue trackers, documentation, web-based and other information resources. However, three key aspects of information work lack good support: (i) combining information from different sources; (ii) flexibly presenting collected information to enable easier comprehension; and (iii) automatically acting on collected information, for example to perform a refactoring. Poor support for these activities makes many common development tasks time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach that directly addresses these three issues by integrating a flexible query mechanism into the development environment.

In this paper we consider all test inputs and we assume we have no prior knowledge about the likelihood of any specific inputs. We will also show how varying the strength of the oracle have a big impact on the results. We only consider a few mutation operators (mostly relational), only a handful of programs to mutate (amenable to probabilistic symbolic execution), and only consider how likely it is that a mutant is killed. A core finding is that the likelihood of reaching the source line where the mutation is applied, is an important contributor to the likelihood of killing the mutant and when we control for this we can see which operators create mutations that are too easy versus very hard to kill.',0,'Mutation Testing;Probabilistic Symbolic Execution',16,'Java;Testing;Radiation detectors;Probabilistic logic;Measurement;Software,probability;program testing;source code (software),mutation operator;test suite;test input;probabilistic symbolic execution;source line','What makes killing a mutant hard'),(11289,'Synchronous embedded systems are becoming more and more complicated and are usually implemented with integrated hardware/software solutions. This implementation manner brings new challenges to the traditional model-driven design environments such as SCADE and STATEMATE, that supports pure hardware or software design. In this paper, we propose a co-design tool Tsmart-Edola to facilitate the system developers, and automatically generate the executable VHDL code and C code from the formal verified SyncBlock computation model. SyncBlock is a lightweight high-level system specification model with well defined syntax, simulation and formal semantics. Based on which, the graphical model editor, graphical simulator, verification translator, and code generator are implemented and seamlessly integrated into the Tsmart-Edola. For evaluation, we apply Tsmart-Edola to the design of a real-world train controller based on the international standard IEC 61375. Several critical ambiguousness or bugs in the standard are detected during formal verification of the constructed system model. Furthermore, the generated VHDL code and C code of Tsmart-Edola outperform that of the state-of-the-art tools in terms of synthesized gate array resource consumption and binary code size.

Despite CI rising as a big success story in automated software engineering, it has received almost no attention from the research community.

Without answering such questions, developers, tool builders, and researchers make decisions based on folklore instead of data. In this paper, we use three complementary methods to study the usage of CI in open-source projects. To understand which CI systems developers use, we analyzed 34,544 open-source projects from GitHub. To understand how developers use CI, we analyzed 1,529,291 builds from the most commonly used CI system. To understand why projects use or do not use CI, we surveyed 442 developers.

Existing methods focus on binary relatedness (i.e., related or not), and are not robust to recognize different classes of semantic relatedness when linkable knowledge units share few words in common (i.e., have lexical gap). In this paper, we formulate the problem of predicting semantically linkable knowledge units as a multiclass classification problem, and solve the problem using deep learning techniques. To overcome the lexical gap issue, we adopt neural language model (word embeddings) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture word- and document-level semantics of knowledge units. Instead of using human-engineered classifier features which are hard to design for informal user-generated content, we exploit large amounts of different types of user-created knowledge-unit links to train the CNN to learn the most informative wordlevel and document-level features for the multiclass classification task.

Various static analysis and dynamic testing techniques have been proposed to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities. With automatic tool support, static buffer overflow detection technique has been widely used in academia and industry. However, it tends to report too many false positives fundamentally due to the lack of software execution information. Currently, static warnings can only be validated by manual inspection, which significantly limits the practicality of the static analysis. In this paper, we present BovInspector, a tool framework for automatic static buffer overflow warnings inspection and validated bugs repair. Given the program source code and static buffer overflow vulnerability warnings, BovInspector first performs warning reachability analysis. Then, BovInspector executes the source code symbolically under the guidance of reachable warnings. Each reachable warning is validated and classified by checking whether all the path conditions and the buffer overflow constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. For each validated true warning, BovInspector fix it with three predefined strategies. BovInspector is complementary to prior static buffer overflow discovery schemes. Experimental results on real open source programs show that BovInspector can automatically inspect on average of 74.9% of total warnings, and false warnings account for about 25% to 100% (on average of 59.9%) of the total inspected warnings. In addition, the automatically generated patches fix all target vulnerabilities.

This allows storing the same input data in formats and databases most suitable for the intended analysis without requiring additional coding.

To better understand interactions in practice, we analyze program traces to characterize and identify where interactions occur on control flow and data. To this end, we developed a dynamic analysis for Java based on variability-aware execution and monitor executions of multiple small to medium-sized programs. We find that the essential configuration complexity of these programs is indeed much lower than the combinatorial explosion of the configuration space indicates.

However, one of the most important obstacles for data sharing is the privacy concerns of software development organizations.

In this paper, we aim to provide data owners with an effective approach of privatizing their data before release. We firstly design an Interval Covering based Subclass Division (ICSD) strategy. ICSD can divide the target data into several subclasses by digging a new attribute (i.e., class label) from the effort data. And the obtained class label is beneficial to maintaining the distribution of the target data after obfuscation. Then, we propose a manifold learning based bi-directional data obfuscation (MLBDO) algorithm, which uses two nearest neighbors, which are selected respectively from the previous and next subclasses by utilizing the manifold learning based nearest neighbor selector, as the disturbances to obfuscate the target sample. We call the entire approach as ICSD&MLBDO.

Transfer learning has been the subject of much recent research. In practice, that research means changing models all the time as transfer learners continually exchange new models to the current project. This paper offers a very simple “bellwether” transfer learner. Given N data sets, we find which one produces the best predictions on all the others. This “bellwether” data set is then used for all subsequent predictions (or, until such time as its predictions start failing-at which point it is wise to seek another bellwether). Bellwethers are interesting since they are very simple to find (just wrap a for-loop around standard data miners). Also, they simplify the task of making general policies in SE since as long as one bellwether remains useful, stable conclusions for N data sets can be achieved just by reasoning over that bellwether. From this, we conclude (1) this bellwether method is a useful (and very simple) transfer learning method; (2) “bellwethers” are a baseline method against which future transfer learners should be compared; (3) sometimes, when building increasingly complex automatic methods, researchers should pause and compare their supposedly more sophisticated method against simpler alternatives.',0,'Defect Prediction;Data Mining;Transfer learning',50,'Software;Learning systems;Testing;Manuals;Buildings;Predictive models;Complexity theory,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);software quality,bellwether effect;transfer learning;software quality predictor;data mining','Too much automation?

While previous work allows one to identify boundary conditions for conflicting goals written in LTL, it does so through a pattern-based approach, that supports a limited set of patterns, and only produces pre-determined formulations of boundary conditions. We present a novel automated approach to compute boundary conditions for general classes of conflicting goals expressed in LTL, using a tableaux-based LTL satisfiability procedure. A tableau for an LTL formula is a finite representation of all its satisfying models, which we process to produce boundary conditions that violate the formula, indicating divergence situations.

The optimization problems are then handled by the underlying optimization solver through machine learning guided sampling and validation.
