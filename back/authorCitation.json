Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Tools', 'Java', 'Runtime', 'Open source software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['hybrid RTS approach', 'granularity RTS', 'selected test ratio', 'offline testing time', 'method-level changes', 'instance method additions/deletions', 'file-level changes', 'online testing time', 'code changes', 'RTS techniques', 'hybrid regression test selection', 'regression testing cost reduction', 'HyRTS technique', 'FRTS'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test selection', 'Regression testing', 'Dynamic analysis', 'Empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453079","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingming Zhang","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730161"},{"$numberLong":"8730207"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8804429"},{"$numberLong":"8812109"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8812033"},{"$numberLong":"8854715"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx.

Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However, the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherently nonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria. In this paper, we propose a framework that formulates the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we programmatically transform this nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly available dataset and minimization problems involving multiple criteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability, and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the optimal solutions outperform the suboptimal ones by up to 164.29% in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Minimization', 'Linear programming', 'Optimization', 'Mathematical model', 'Tools', 'Testing', 'Programming'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['integer programming', 'linear programming', 'minimisation', 'nonlinear programming', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['redundant test cases', 'optimal solution', 'multicriteria test-suite minimization problem', 'test-case criteria', 'integer nonlinear programming problem'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test-suite minimization', 'integer programming']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453182","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jun-Wei Lin;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Joshua Garcia;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8753481"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

As the Linux kernel forms the central part of various operating systems that are used by millions of users, the kernel must be continuously adapted to the changing demands and expectations of these users. The Linux kernel provides its services to an application through system calls. The combined set of all system calls forms the essential Application Programming Interface (API) through which an application interacts with the kernel. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 8,770 changes that were made to Linux system calls during the last decade (i.e., from April 2005 to December 2014). In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls). In addition, we find that by far, the ptraceand signal handling system calls are the most challenging to maintain. Our study can be used by developers who want to improve the design and ensure the successful evolution of their own kernel APIs.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Linux', 'Kernel', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Linux', 'operating system kernels', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['essential application programming interface', 'kernel API', 'sibling calls', 'operating systems', 'Linux kernel forms', 'Linux system calls'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Linux kernel', 'System calls', 'API evolution', 'Software evolution']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453085","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mojtaba Bagherzadeh;Nafiseh Kahani;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community.

Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study.

Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Most research and applications of such approach focus on N-way combinatorial testing that provides a minimum coverage of all N-way interactions among factor. However, the strengths of different interactions may not be a fixed integer N, but a variable. Therefore, variable strength combinatorial testing approach is necessary in applications. Existing variable strength combinatorial testing, which allows some interactions have a higher strength than others, has a limitation that such higher-strength interactions must be disjoint. To avoid such a limitation, an improved variable strength combinatorial testing approach, which makes a more sufficient consideration on actual interaction relationship, is proposed in this article. Furthermore, two greedy heuristic algorithms are also proposed to generate combinatorial test suite. Compared to some existing algorithms and tools, the proposed algorithms have advantages on both the execution effectiveness and the optimality of generated test suite. Experimental results can prove such advantages.","conference":"The International Conference on Quality Software","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Arrays', 'Fault currents', 'Circuit faults', 'Current transformers', 'Computed tomography', 'Algorithm design and analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['combinatorial mathematics', 'greedy algorithms', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['greedy heuristic algorithms', 'variable strength combinatorial test suite', 'software testing', 'N-way combinatorial testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'combinatorial testing', 'variable strength', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4601539","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":4,"year":2008,"authors":"Ziyuan Wang;Baowen Xu;Changhai Nie","affiliations":";;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c6b04a430c4a6678a3"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"5358586"},{"$numberLong":"7372037"},{"$numberLong":"5676343"},{"$numberLong":"6649874"},{"$numberLong":"7275918"},{"$numberLong":"6571649"},{"$numberLong":"7528950"},{"$numberLong":"5958995"},{"$numberLong":"5959020"},{"$numberLong":"4601539"},{"$numberLong":"5381411"},{"$numberLong":"5453905"},{"$numberLong":"8441104"},{"$numberLong":"8789816"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1583600"},{"$numberLong":"1319088"},{"$numberLong":"4601539"},{"$numberLong":"979992"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

To identify and handle such malware, a security analyst can significantly benefit from identifying the family to which a malicious app belongs rather than only detecting if an app is malicious. To address these challenges, we present a novel machine learning-based Android malware detection and family-identification approach, RevealDroid, that operates without the need to perform complex program analyses or extract large sets of features. RevealDroid's selected features leverage categorized Android API usage, reflection-based features, and features from native binaries of apps. We assess RevealDroid for accuracy, efficiency, and obfuscation resilience using a large dataset consisting of more than 54,000 malicious and benign apps. Our experiments show that RevealDroid achieves an accuracy of 98% in detection of malware and an accuracy of 95% in determination of their families.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453120","title":"[Journal First] ChangeLocator: Locate Crash-Inducing Changes Based on Crash Reports","abstract":"Software crashes are severe manifestations of software bugs. Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Due to the lack of namespaces in JavaScript, these libraries all share the same global namespace. As a result, one library may inadvertently modify or even delete the APIs of another library, causing unexpected behavior of library clients. Given the quickly increasing number of libraries, manually keeping track of such conflicts is practically impossible both for library developers and users. This paper presents ConflictJS, an automated and scalable approach to analyze libraries for conflicts. The key idea is to tackle the huge search space of possible conflicts in two phases. At first, a dynamic analysis of individual libraries identifies pairs of potentially conflicting libraries. Then, targeted test synthesis validates potential conflicts by creating a client application that suffers from a conflict. The overall approach is free of false positives, in the sense that it reports a problem only when such a client exists. We use ConflictJS to analyze and study conflicts among 951 real-world libraries. The results show that one out of four libraries is potentially conflicting and that 166 libraries are involved in at least one certain conflict. The detected conflicts cause crashes and other kinds of unexpected behavior. Our work helps library developers to prevent conflicts, library users to avoid combining conflicting libraries, and provides evidence that designing a language without explicit namespaces has undesirable effects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Loading', 'Computer crashes', 'Cryptography', 'Content distribution networks', 'Servers'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Internet', 'Java', 'libraries', 'system monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['ConflictJS', 'JavaScript libraries', 'client-side web applications', 'global namespace', 'search space', 'dynamic analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['JavaScript libraries', 'testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453147","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jibesh Patra;Pooja N.

Dynamic analysis is effective in producing execution traces that assist comprehension. Traces are rich sources of information regarding the behaviour of a program. However, it is challenging to gain insight from traces due to their overwhelming amount of data and complexity. We propose a generic technique for facilitating comprehension by inferring recurring execution motifs. Inspired by bioinformatics, motifs are patterns in traces that are flexible to small changes in execution, and are captured in a hierarchical model.

Test minimization aims at removing redundant test cases. However, current techniques remove whole test cases from the test suite using test adequacy criteria, such as code coverage. This has two limitations, namely (1) by removing a whole test case the corresponding test assertions are also lost, which can inhibit test suite effectiveness, (2) the issue of partly redundant test cases, i.e., tests with redundant test statements, is ignored. We propose a novel approach for fine-grained test case minimization. Our analysis is based on the inference of a test suite model that enables automated test reorganization within test cases. It enables removing redundancies at the test statement level, while preserving the coverage and test assertions of the test suite. We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called Testler, on the test suites of 15 open source projects. Our analysis shows that over 4,639 (24%) of the tests in these test suites are partly redundant, with over 11,819 redundant test statements in total. Our results show that Testler removes 43% of the redundant test statements, reducing the number of partly redundant tests by 52%. As a result, test suite execution time is reduced by up to 37% (20% on average), while maintaining the original statement coverage, branch coverage, test assertions, and fault detection capability.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Production', 'Minimization', 'Redundancy', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Software engineering', 'Software systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['test minimization', 'test adequacy criteria', 'corresponding test assertions', 'test suite effectiveness', 'partly redundant test cases', 'fine-grained test case minimization', 'test suite model', 'test reorganization', 'test statement level', 'partly redundant tests', 'test suite execution time', 'redundant test statements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['test minization', 'test reduction', 'test redundancy', 'test model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453080","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Arash Vahabzadeh;Andrea Stocco;Ali Mesbah","affiliations":"Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to the lack of namespaces in JavaScript, these libraries all share the same global namespace. As a result, one library may inadvertently modify or even delete the APIs of another library, causing unexpected behavior of library clients. Given the quickly increasing number of libraries, manually keeping track of such conflicts is practically impossible both for library developers and users. This paper presents ConflictJS, an automated and scalable approach to analyze libraries for conflicts. The key idea is to tackle the huge search space of possible conflicts in two phases. At first, a dynamic analysis of individual libraries identifies pairs of potentially conflicting libraries. Then, targeted test synthesis validates potential conflicts by creating a client application that suffers from a conflict. The overall approach is free of false positives, in the sense that it reports a problem only when such a client exists. We use ConflictJS to analyze and study conflicts among 951 real-world libraries. The results show that one out of four libraries is potentially conflicting and that 166 libraries are involved in at least one certain conflict. The detected conflicts cause crashes and other kinds of unexpected behavior. Our work helps library developers to prevent conflicts, library users to avoid combining conflicting libraries, and provides evidence that designing a language without explicit namespaces has undesirable effects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Loading', 'Computer crashes', 'Cryptography', 'Content distribution networks', 'Servers'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Internet', 'Java', 'libraries', 'system monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['ConflictJS', 'JavaScript libraries', 'client-side web applications', 'global namespace', 'search space', 'dynamic analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['JavaScript libraries', 'testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453147","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jibesh Patra;Pooja N.

Dynamic analysis is effective in producing execution traces that assist comprehension. Traces are rich sources of information regarding the behaviour of a program. However, it is challenging to gain insight from traces due to their overwhelming amount of data and complexity. We propose a generic technique for facilitating comprehension by inferring recurring execution motifs. Inspired by bioinformatics, motifs are patterns in traces that are flexible to small changes in execution, and are captured in a hierarchical model. The hierarchical nature of the model provides an overview of the behaviour at a high-level, while preserving the execution details and intermediate levels in a structured manner.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This study has applications in source code generation, code completion, and software forensics and investigation. The study also benefits software developers and programmers striving to improve code efficiency and speed up development process. With source code analysis, the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) which is very useful in NLP, becomes severely limited by its inability to handle the semantic and syntactic properties of source codes. Therefore, we processed the source code datasets as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) rather than the source code text itself to take advantage of the information-rich structure of the AST. The proposed model is built on the deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures.

However, some fundamental questions, such as how new fixes overlap with old fixes, have not been investigated. Intuitively, the overlap between old and new fixes decides how APR approaches can construct new fixes with old ones. Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes. Our results show that if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the content of past fixes, only 2.1% and 3.2% new fixes can be created from single or multiple past fixes in the same project, compared with 0.9% and 1.2% fixes created from past fixes across projects.

These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance. We then evaluate each approach in 2,135 queries extracted from three open source software and one industrial software system. Our results show that GA is able to completely cover 98.6% of all queries in the dataset, requiring only a few seconds per query. Moreover, it does not suffer from the limitations affecting state-of-the art techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Databases', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Search problems', 'Structured Query Language', 'Toy manufacturing industry', 'Software systems', 'Engines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['database management systems', 'genetic algorithms', 'program testing', 'query processing', 'search problems', 'SQL'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['SQL query', 'complex queries', 'model test data generation', 'physical query plan', 'Search-Based Test Data Generation', 'database-centric systems', 'SQL queries', 'SQL commands', 'constraint satisfaction problem', 'search-based problem', 'biased random search', 'genetic algorithms', 'database engine', 'search guidance', 'open source software', 'industrial software system'], 'Author Keywords ': ['search based software engineering', 'automated test data generation', 'SQL', 'databases']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453204","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jeroen Castelein;Maurício Aniche;Mozhan Soltani;Annibale Panichella;Arie van Deursen","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812175"},{"$numberLong":"8919030"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453124","title":"Understanding Developers' Needs on Deprecation as a Language Feature","abstract":"Deprecation is a language feature that allows API producers to mark a feature as obsolete. We aim to gain a deep understanding of the needs of API producers and consumers alike regarding deprecation. To that end, we investigate why API producers deprecate features, whether they remove deprecated features, how they expect consumers to react, and what prompts an API consumer to react to deprecation.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

The OFA and the fSTS were sensitive only to the presence of real face parts, not to the correct configuration of those parts, whereas the FFA was sensitive to both face parts and face configuration. Further, only in the FFA was the response to configuration and part information correlated across voxels, suggesting that the FFA contains a unified representation that includes both kinds of information.

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

Past work focused on automated test generation to detect crashes in Android apps. However, automated repair of crashes has not been studied. In this paper, we propose the first approach to automatically repair Android apps, specifically we propose a technique for fixing crashes in Android apps. Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions). These results confirm our intuition that our proposed transformations form a sufficient set of operators to patch crashes in Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer crashes', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Mobile applications', 'Transistors', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android apps', 'test-based repair approaches', 'benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated repair', 'Android apps', 'Crash', 'SBSE']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453078","citationCount":7,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shin Hwei Tan;Zhen Dong;Xiang Gao;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":"Southern Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Shenzhen, China;Nat.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results.

Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides: When the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Feature extraction', 'Computer bugs', 'Navigation', 'History', 'Tools', 'Visualization', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['feature extraction', 'information retrieval', 'pattern clustering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying features', 'fork-based development', 'open source communities', 'INFOX', 'nonmerged features', 'clusters cohesive code fragments', 'network-analysis techniques', 'information-retrieval techniques', 'human-subject evaluation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Fork-based development', 'Github', 'Community detection', 'Information retrieval', 'overview of forks', 'transparency']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453068","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shurui Zhou;Stefan Stanciulescu;Olaf Leßenich;Yingfei Xiong;Andrzej Wasowski;Christian Kästner","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"},{"$numberLong":"8952413"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Agile process models recommend Test Driven Development (TDD) as a key practice for reducing costs and improving code quality. The objective of this work is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of this practice. Previous work by Fucci et al. engaged in laboratory studies of developers actively engaged in test-driven development practices. Fucci et al. found little difference between test-first behaviour of TDD and test-later behaviour. To that end, we opted to conduct a study about TDD behaviours in the \"wild\" rather than in the laboratory. Thus we have conducted a comparative analysis of GitHub repositories that adopts TDD to a lesser or greater extent, in order to determine how TDD affects software development productivity and software quality. We classified GitHub repositories archived in 2015 in terms of how rigorously they practiced TDD, thus creating a TDD spectrum. We then matched and compared various subsets of these repositories on this TDD spectrum with control sets of equal size. The control sets were samples from all GitHub repositories that matched certain characteristics, and that contained at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets differed from the control sets on the following characteristics: number of test files, average commit velocity, number of bug-referencing commits, number of issues recorded, usage of continuous integration, number of pull requests, and distribution of commits per author. We found that Java TDD projects were relatively rare. In addition, there were very few significant differences in any of the metrics we used to compare TDD-like and non-TDD projects; therefore, our results do not reveal any observable benefits from using TDD.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Testing', 'Computational modeling', 'Java', 'Blogs', 'Analytical models'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['cost-benefit analysis', 'Java', 'program testing', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'software quality', 'software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['GitHub repositories', 'TDD spectrum', 'control sets', 'test file', 'TDD sets', 'Java TDD projects', 'nonTDD projects', 'software development lifecycle', 'agile process models', 'improving code quality', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'test-driven development practices', 'test-first behaviour', 'test-later behaviour', 'software development productivity', 'software quality', 'test driven development'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test Driven Development', 'Human Factors in Software Development', 'GitHub Repositories', 'Continuous Integration']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453184","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Neil Borle;Meysam Feghhi;Eleni Stroulia;Russell Grenier;Abram Hindle","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

A common repair approach is to iteratively first generate candidate programs with possible bug fixes and then validate them against the given tests until a candidate that passes all the tests is found. While this approach is conceptually simple, due to the potentially high number of candidates that need to first be generated and then be compiled and tested, existing repair techniques that embody this approach have relatively low effectiveness, especially for faults at a fine granularity. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a novel repair technique, SketchFix, which generates candidate fixes on demand (as needed) during the test execution. Instead of iteratively re-compiling and re-executing each actual candidate program, SketchFix translates faulty programs to sketches, i.e., partial programs with \"holes\", and compiles each sketch once which may represent thousands of concrete candidates. With the insight that the space of candidates can be reduced substantially by utilizing the runtime behaviors of the tests, SketchFix lazily initializes the candidates of the sketches while validating them against the test execution. We experimentally evaluate SketchFix on the Defects4J benchmark and the experimental results show that SketchFix works particularly well in repairing bugs with expression manipulation at the AST node-level granularity compared to other program repair techniques. Specifically, SketchFix correctly fixes 19 out of 357 defects in 23 minutes on average using the default setting. In addition, SketchFix finds the first repair with 1.6% of re-compilations (#compiled sketches/#candidates) and 3.0% of re-executions out of all repair candidates.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Computer bugs', 'Runtime', 'Syntactics', 'Debugging', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['effective program repair techniques', 'faulty programs', 'manual debugging', 'common repair approach', 'candidate programs', 'possible bug fixes', 'relatively low effectiveness', 'novel repair technique', 'SketchFix', 'candidate fixes', 'test execution', 'iteratively re-compiling', 're-executing each actual candidate program', 'partial programs', 'concrete candidates', 're-compilations', 'repair candidates', 'practical program repair', 'on-demand candidate generation', '#compiled sketches-#candidates'], 'Author Keywords ': ['debugging', 'program repair', 'program synthesis', 'lazy initialization', 'execution driven pruning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453056","citationCount":14,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jinru Hua;Mengshi Zhang;Kaiyuan Wang;Sarfraz Khurshid","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8665493"},{"$numberLong":"8665475"},{"$numberLong":"8667970"},{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8802763"},{"$numberLong":"8802695"},{"$numberLong":"8812056"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952344"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Among these techniques, Statistical Fault Localization (SFL) is particularly popular. One issue with SFL is that it is based on strong, often unrealistic assumptions on how developers behave when debugging. To address this problem, we propose Enlighten, an interactive, feedback-driven fault localization technique. Given a failing test, Enlighten (1) leverages SFL and dynamic dependence analysis to identify suspicious method invocations and corresponding data values, (2) presents the developer with a query about the most suspicious invocation expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, (3) encodes the developer feedback on the correctness of individual data values as extra program specifications, and (4) repeats these steps until the fault is found. We evaluated Enlighten in two ways. First, we applied Enlighten to 1,807 real and seeded faults in 3 open source programs using an automated oracle as a simulated user; for over 96% of these faults, Enlighten required less than 10 interactions with the simulated user to localize the fault, and a sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to erroneous responses. Second, we performed an actual user study on 4 faults with 24 participants and found that participants who used Enlighten performed significantly better than those not using our tool, in terms of both number of faults localized and time needed to localize the faults.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Performance analysis', 'Tools', 'Generators', 'Calculators', 'Software debugging', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['fault diagnosis', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['enlightened debugging', 'numerous automated techniques', 'software debugging', 'notoriously time-consuming', 'human-intensive activity', 'unrealistic assumptions', 'feedback-driven fault localization technique', 'Enlighten leverages SFL', 'dynamic dependence analysis', 'developer feedback', 'individual data values', 'extra program specifications', 'automated oracle', 'sensitivity analysis', 'open source programs', 'statistical fault localization'], 'Author Keywords ': ['debugging', 'fault localization', 'dynamic analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453065","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiangyu Li;Shaowei Zhu;Marcelo d’Amorim;Alessandro Orso","affiliations":"Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA;Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA;Fed.

However, due to its nature and intent, activity concealing is not disclosed up-front, which puts users at risk. In this paper, we focus on characterization and detection of such techniques, e.g., hiding the app or removing traces, which we call \"self hiding behavior\" (SHB). SHB has not been studied per se - rather it has been reported on only as a byproduct of malware investigations. We address this gap via a study and suite of static analyses targeted at SH in Android apps. Specifically, we present (1) a detailed characterization of SHB, (2) a suite of static analyses to detect such behavior, and (3) a set of detectors that employ SHB to distinguish between benign and malicious apps. We show that SHB ranges from hiding the app's presence or activity to covering an app's traces, e.g., by blocking phone calls/text messages or removing calls and messages from logs. Using our static analysis tools on a large dataset of 9,452 Android apps (benign as well as malicious) we expose the frequency of 12 such SH behaviors. Our approach is effective: it has revealed that malicious apps employ 1.5 SHBs per app on average. Surprisingly, SH behavior is also employed by legitimate (\"benign\") apps, which can affect users negatively in multiple ways. When using our approach for separating malicious from benign apps, our approach has high precision and recall (combined F-measure = 87.19%). Our approach is also efficient, with analysis typically taking just 37 seconds per app. We believe that our findings and analysis tool are beneficial to both app marketplaces and end-users.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Smart phones', 'Tools', 'Static analysis', 'Security', 'Google', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android apps', 'trace removal', 'self hiding behavior detection', 'activity concealing', 'app marketplaces', 'benign apps', 'legitimate apps', 'malicious apps', 'static analyses'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'static analysis', 'malware', 'mobile security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453145","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhiyong Shan;Iulian Neamtiu;Raina Samuel","affiliations":"Wichita State Univ., Wichita, KS, USA;New Jersey Inst. of Technol., Newark, NJ, USA;New Jersey Inst. of Technol., Newark, NJ, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8720030"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"7381843","title":"Experience report: How do bug characteristics differ across severity classes: A multi-platform study","abstract":"Bugs of different severities have so far been put into the same category, but their characteristics differ significantly.

In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s).

Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities.

In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon.

Why Licensing Bugs Matter","abstract":"Software licenses dictate how source code or binaries can be modified, reused, and redistributed. In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s). Developers and organizations can also modify existing licenses, creating custom licenses with specific permissive/restrictive terms. Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities. Our findings uncover new types of licensing bugs not addressed in prior literature, and a detailed assessment of their implications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses', 'Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Law', 'Guidelines', 'Stakeholders'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software projects', 'software licenses', 'custom licenses', 'software developers', 'license incompatibilities', 'licensing bug developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software Licenses', 'Empirical Studies', 'Open Source Practices']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453086","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Vendome;Daniel German;Massimiliano Di Penta;Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia;Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8930891"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"6945855","title":"The Impact of API Change- and Fault-Proneness on the User Ratings of Android Apps","abstract":"The mobile apps market is one of the fastest growing areas in the information technology.

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

The results show that smells characterized by long and/or complex code (e.g., Complex Class) are highly diffused, and that smelly classes have a higher change- and fault-proneness than smell-free classes.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'History', 'Detectors', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Software systems', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['public domain software', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software maintainability', 'code fault-proneness', 'code change-proneness', 'open source projects', 'code comprehensibility', 'scale empirical investigation', 'code smells', 'smell-free classes', 'complex code'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical studies', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453110","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Gabriele Bavota;Massimiliano Di Penta;Fausto Fasano;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Univ. della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Most research and applications of such approach focus on N-way combinatorial testing that provides a minimum coverage of all N-way interactions among factor. However, the strengths of different interactions may not be a fixed integer N, but a variable. Therefore, variable strength combinatorial testing approach is necessary in applications. Existing variable strength combinatorial testing, which allows some interactions have a higher strength than others, has a limitation that such higher-strength interactions must be disjoint. To avoid such a limitation, an improved variable strength combinatorial testing approach, which makes a more sufficient consideration on actual interaction relationship, is proposed in this article. Furthermore, two greedy heuristic algorithms are also proposed to generate combinatorial test suite. Compared to some existing algorithms and tools, the proposed algorithms have advantages on both the execution effectiveness and the optimality of generated test suite.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in real-world code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Tools', 'Static analysis', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Safety'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal verification', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification', 'software quality', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['bug-finding tools', 'static analysis', 'real-world code', 'undiscovered bugs', 'source-level patches', 'resource leaks', 'general pointer safety properties', 'program fragments', 'semantic effects', 'automated program repair technique', 'verification techniques', 'test suite', 'memory leaks', 'software quality', 'static analysis tools', 'heap properties', 'static automated Program Repair'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Separation Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453073","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rijnard van Tonder;Claire Le Goues","affiliations":";","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8823627"},{"$numberLong":"8823644"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453074","title":"[Journal First] Overfitting in Semantics-Based Automated Program Repair","abstract":"The primary goal of Automated Program Repair (APR) is to automatically fix buggy software, to reduce the manual bug-fix burden that presently rests on human developers. Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

This article details the need for a new set of benchmarks, outlines requirements, and then presents two datasets, ManyBugs and IntroClass, consisting between them of 1,183 defects in 15 C programs. Each dataset is designed to support the comparative evaluation of automatic repair algorithms asking a variety of experimental questions. The datasets have empirically defined guarantees of reproducibility and benchmark quality, and each study object is categorized to facilitate qualitative evaluation and comparisons by category of bug or program.

The simultaneous presence of these bugs may deteriorate the effectiveness of existing fault-localization techniques to locate program bugs. While it is acceptable to use all failed and successful tests to identify suspicious code for programs with exactly one bug, it is not appropriate to use the same approach for programs with multiple bugs because the due-to relationship between failed tests and underlying bugs cannot be easily identified. One solution is to generate fault-focused clusters by grouping failed tests caused by the same bug into the same clusters. We propose MSeer - an advanced fault localization technique for locating multiple bugs in parallel. Our major contributions include the use of (1) a revised Kendall tau distance to measure the distance between two failed tests, (2) an innovative approach to simultaneously estimate the number of clusters and assign initial medoids to these clusters, and (3) an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm to better identify the due-to relationship between failed tests and their corresponding bugs.

Past work focused on automated test generation to detect crashes in Android apps. However, automated repair of crashes has not been studied. In this paper, we propose the first approach to automatically repair Android apps, specifically we propose a technique for fixing crashes in Android apps. Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions). These results confirm our intuition that our proposed transformations form a sufficient set of operators to patch crashes in Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer crashes', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Mobile applications', 'Transistors', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android apps', 'test-based repair approaches', 'benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated repair', 'Android apps', 'Crash', 'SBSE']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453078","citationCount":7,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shin Hwei Tan;Zhen Dong;Xiang Gao;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":"Southern Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Shenzhen, China;Nat.

Prior works show the feasibility of automated repair, and the research focus is gradually shifting towards the quality of generated patches. One promising direction is to control the quality of generated patches by controlling the quality of test-suites used. In this paper, we investigate the question: \"\"Can traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing be used for automated program repair?\"\". We empirically investigate the effectiveness of test-suite metrics (statement / branch coverage and mutation score) in controlling the reliability of repairs (the likelihood that repairs cause regressions). We conduct the largest-scale experiments to date with real-world software, and perform the first correlation study between test-suite metrics and the reliability of generated repairs. Our results show that by increasing test-suite metrics, the reliability of repairs tend to increase. Particularly, such trend is most strongly observed in statement coverage. This implies that traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing can also be used to improve the reliability of repairs in program repair.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Measurement', 'Correlation', 'Software reliability', 'Software', 'Software testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['regressions', 'test-suite metrics', 'automated repair', 'generated repairs', 'correlation study', 'automated program repair', 'software testing', 'test-suites', 'generated patches'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code Coverage', 'Program Repair', 'Mutation Testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453057","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jooyong Yi;Shin Hwei Tan;Sergey Mechtaev;Marcel Böhme;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s).

Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities.

In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Servers', 'Security', 'Databases', 'Static analysis', 'Feature extraction'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile-app behaviors', 'EnMobile', 'benign apps', 'entity-based characterization', 'modern mobile malware', 'mobile platform', 'modern mobile apps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Analysis', 'Mobile Security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453096","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wei Yang;Mukul Prasad;Tao Xie","affiliations":";Fujitsu Labs. of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816783"},{"$numberLong":"8913874"},{"$numberLong":"8952382"},{"$numberLong":"8952509"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven's default flaky test detector.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Monitoring', 'Testing', 'Java', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Syntactics', 'Detectors'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing', 'public domain software', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DeFlaker', 'test failure', 'unknown flaky tests'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'flaky tests', 'code coverage']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453104","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jonathan Bell;Owolabi Legunsen;Michael Hilton;Lamyaa Eloussi;Tifany Yung;Darko Marinov","affiliations":"George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719555"},{"$numberLong":"8730188"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8821891"},{"$numberLong":"8952328"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Existing composition strategies rarely address the influence of the environment, which may influence QoS and thus lead to sub-optimal composition policies in a dynamic environment. In this study, a model-based service composition approach is proposed. Given the user request, it is possible to first find a set of matching abstract web services (AWSs), and then pull relevant concrete web services (CWSs) based on the AWSs. The set of CWSs can be modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). In addition, the authors model the environment as a fully probabilistic system, capturing changes of environment probabilistically. The environment model can be further composed of the MDP from the service models, obtaining a monolithic MDP.

Existing composition strategies rarely address the influence of the environment, which may influence QoS and thus lead to sub-optimal composition policies in a dynamic environment. In this study, a model-based service composition approach is proposed. Given the user request, it is possible to first find a set of matching abstract web services (AWSs), and then pull relevant concrete web services (CWSs) based on the AWSs. The set of CWSs can be modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). In addition, the authors model the environment as a fully probabilistic system, capturing changes of environment probabilistically. The environment model can be further composed of the MDP from the service models, obtaining a monolithic MDP. They demonstrate how the probabilistic verification techniques can be used to find the optimal service selection strategy against their QoS and the environment change.

We conducted an empirical study on StackOverflow posts, aiming to understand developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and insecure coding practices. We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and documentation, as well as the huge gap between security theory and coding practices.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Java', 'Cryptography', 'Encoding', 'Libraries', 'Programming', 'Authentication'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'authorisation', 'computer crime', 'cryptography', 'Java', 'XML'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['secure coding practices', 'Java platform', 'third-party libraries', 'developers time', 'empirical study', 'StackOverflow posts', 'Java secure coding', 'programming obstacles', 'insecure coding practices', 'authorization features', 'third-party framework', 'programming challenges', 'complicated cross-language data handling', 'complex Java-based', 'XML-based approaches', 'cross-site request forgery attacks', 'Spring security', 'cryptography API', 'SSL-TLS security', 'secure coding assistance', 'StackOverflow forum', 'multiple security vulnerabilities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Secure coding', 'Spring security', 'CSRF', 'SSL/TLS', 'certificate validation', 'cryptographic hash functions', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'StackOverflow', 'cryptography']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453095","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Na Meng;Stefan Nagy;Danfeng Yao;Wenjie Zhuang;Gustavo Arango-Argoty","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

It is essential that this continuous integration scales, guarantees short feedback cycles, and functions reliably with minimal human intervention. During the past three years TSE's charter has been to shorten this cycle time. We went after this goal in two ways: Evolution via CloudBuild and Revolution via Concord. CloudBuild is a build service infrastructure, now being used by all major product groups in Microsoft, like Azure, Bing, Office, SQL except for Windows. CloudBuild addresses all aspects of a continuous integration workflow, like builds, test and code analysis, but also drops, package and symbol creation and storage. CloudBuild supports multiple build languages as long as they fulfill a coarse grained IO based contract. CloudBuild uses content based caching to run build-related tasks only when needed. Lastly, it builds on many machines in parallel. The speed ups of build and testing range from 1.2x to 10x. CloudBuild aims to rapidly onboard teams and hence has to support non-deterministic build tools and specification languages that under-declare dependencies. CloudBuild, being a reliable build service in the presence of unreliable components, currently achieves service availability better than 99%. Windows went a different path. Their past build exhaust was so massive that building Windows in the cloud and bringing the build results back for testing on corp.-net. was considered infeasible. So they decided to move to a new build language, codename Concord. By construction, Concord guarantees reliable builds, no over-build, and allows for efficient distribution. Adopting Concord has led to immense performance improvements, we have seen up to 100X speedup for Windows builds. But the path has been long and rocky, since it not only requires a substantial rewrite of existing build logic, but also all related developer and build lab processes have to change. Whether evolution or revolution is the right path forward - the verdict is still out.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['cache storage', 'cloud computing', 'parallel machines', 'program testing', 'software performance evaluation', 'specification languages'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['microsoft build changing', 'software product testing', 'software product building', 'continuous integration scales', 'short feedback cycles', 'functions reliably', 'minimal human intervention', 'cloudbuild evolution', 'concord revolution', 'content based caching', 'parallel machines', 'non deterministic build tools', 'specification languages', 'performance improvements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Build-system', 'build-language', 'build-automation', 'build-as-a-service']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7582738","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2016,"authors":"Wolfram Schulte","affiliations":"Microsoft, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12bab04a430c4a667700"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Agile process models recommend Test Driven Development (TDD) as a key practice for reducing costs and improving code quality. The objective of this work is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of this practice. Previous work by Fucci et al. engaged in laboratory studies of developers actively engaged in test-driven development practices. Fucci et al. found little difference between test-first behaviour of TDD and test-later behaviour. To that end, we opted to conduct a study about TDD behaviours in the \"wild\" rather than in the laboratory. Thus we have conducted a comparative analysis of GitHub repositories that adopts TDD to a lesser or greater extent, in order to determine how TDD affects software development productivity and software quality. We classified GitHub repositories archived in 2015 in terms of how rigorously they practiced TDD, thus creating a TDD spectrum. We then matched and compared various subsets of these repositories on this TDD spectrum with control sets of equal size. The control sets were samples from all GitHub repositories that matched certain characteristics, and that contained at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets differed from the control sets on the following characteristics: number of test files, average commit velocity, number of bug-referencing commits, number of issues recorded, usage of continuous integration, number of pull requests, and distribution of commits per author. We found that Java TDD projects were relatively rare. In addition, there were very few significant differences in any of the metrics we used to compare TDD-like and non-TDD projects; therefore, our results do not reveal any observable benefits from using TDD.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Testing', 'Computational modeling', 'Java', 'Blogs', 'Analytical models'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['cost-benefit analysis', 'Java', 'program testing', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'software quality', 'software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['GitHub repositories', 'TDD spectrum', 'control sets', 'test file', 'TDD sets', 'Java TDD projects', 'nonTDD projects', 'software development lifecycle', 'agile process models', 'improving code quality', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'test-driven development practices', 'test-first behaviour', 'test-later behaviour', 'software development productivity', 'software quality', 'test driven development'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test Driven Development', 'Human Factors in Software Development', 'GitHub Repositories', 'Continuous Integration']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453184","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Neil Borle;Meysam Feghhi;Eleni Stroulia;Russell Grenier;Abram Hindle","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

A great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager. Through statistical analysis we identify how engineers and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering differs from other knowledge work groups.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Birds', 'Productivity', 'Organizations', 'Tools', 'Knowledge engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP management', 'project management', 'software development management', 'statistical analysis', 'team working'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['great manager', 'software engineers', 'good team', 'software engineering manager', 'software teams', 'manager attributes', 'software engineering research studies', 'statistical analysis', 'productivity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Manager', 'Software Engineering', 'Knowledge Work', 'Empirical Study', 'Conceptual Framework', 'Manager Attributes', 'Technical Skills']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453140","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Eirini Kalliamvakou;Christian Bird;Thomas Zimmermann;Andrew Begel;Robert DeLine;Daniel M.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

To solve hard verification tasks, we need to leverage not just one but several different verifiers employing different technologies. To this end, we need to exchange information between verifiers. Conditional model checking was proposed as a solution to exactly this problem: The idea is to let the first verifier output a condition which describes the state space that it successfully verified and to instruct the second verifier to verify the yet unverified state space using this condition. However, most verifiers do not understand conditions as input. In this paper, we propose the usage of an off-the-shelf construction of a conditional verifier from a given traditional verifier and a reducer. The reducer takes as input the program to be verified and the condition, and outputs a residual program whose paths cover the unverified state space described by the condition. As a proof of concept, we designed and implemented one particular reducer and composed three conditional model checkers from the three best verifiers at SV-COMP 2017. We defined a set of claims and experimentally evaluated their validity. All experimental data and results are available for replication.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Automata', 'Software', 'Model checking', 'Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal verification', 'program diagnostics', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['conditional model checking', 'verifier output', 'unverified state space', 'conditional model checkers', 'hard verification tasks', 'software verification', 'conditional verifier', 'reducer-based construction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Conditional Model Checking', 'Formal Verification', 'Testing', 'Program Analysis', 'Software Verification', 'Sequential Combination']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453199","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Dirk Beyer;Marie-Christine Jakobs;Thomas Lemberger;Heike Wehrheim","affiliations":"LMU Munich, Munich, Germany;LMU Munich, Munich, Germany;LMU Munich, Munich, Germany;Paderborn Univ., Paderborn, Germany","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, automatically generated unit test drivers/stubs raise false alarms because they often over-approximate real contexts of a target function f and allow infeasible executions off. To solve this problem, we have developed a concolic unit testing technique CONBRIO. To provide realistic context to f, it constructs an extended unit of f that consists of f and closely relevant functions to f. Also, CONBRIO filters out a false alarm by checking feasibility of a corresponding symbolic execution path with regard to f's symbolic calling contexts obtained by combining symbolic execution paths of f's closely related predecessor functions. In the experiments on the crash bugs of 15 real-world C programs, CONBRIO shows both high bug detection ability (i.e. 91.0% of the target bugs detected) and high precision (i.e. a true to false alarm ratio is 1:4.5).

We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven's default flaky test detector.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Monitoring', 'Testing', 'Java', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Syntactics', 'Detectors'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing', 'public domain software', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DeFlaker', 'test failure', 'unknown flaky tests'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'flaky tests', 'code coverage']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453104","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jonathan Bell;Owolabi Legunsen;Michael Hilton;Lamyaa Eloussi;Tifany Yung;Darko Marinov","affiliations":"George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719555"},{"$numberLong":"8730188"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8821891"},{"$numberLong":"8952328"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first largescale study of software engineers' working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours.

Developers are especially active on these Q\u0026A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q\u0026A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q\u0026A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q\u0026A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q\u0026A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that (i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; (ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; (iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q\u0026A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Knowledge engineering', 'Computer science', 'Logistics', 'Analytical models', 'Mathematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['human factors', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'regression analysis', 'software engineering', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['technical questions', 'incentive systems', 'answer questions', 'rapid answering', 'Q\u0026A website', 'fast answering', 'answerer dimension', 'accepted answer', 'question dimension', 'answer dimension', 'nonfrequent answerers', 'current incentive system motivates frequent answerers', 'answer short questions', 'question answering incentive system', 'stack exchange Websites', 'answer Websites'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Q\u0026A website', 'Factor importance analysis', 'Response time']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453164","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shaowei Wang;Tse-Hsun Chen;Ahmed E.

To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities.

In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls). In addition, we find that by far, the ptraceand signal handling system calls are the most challenging to maintain. Our study can be used by developers who want to improve the design and ensure the successful evolution of their own kernel APIs.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Linux', 'Kernel', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Linux', 'operating system kernels', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['essential application programming interface', 'kernel API', 'sibling calls', 'operating systems', 'Linux kernel forms', 'Linux system calls'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Linux kernel', 'System calls', 'API evolution', 'Software evolution']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453085","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mojtaba Bagherzadeh;Nafiseh Kahani;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

In turn, consumers can influence the software development process by giving developers early feedback. This early access model has become increasingly popular through digital distribution platforms, such as Steam which is the most popular distribution platform for games. The plethora of options offered by Steam to communicate between developers and game players contribute to the popularity of the early access model. The early access model made a name for itself through several successful games, such as the DayZ game. The multiplayer survival-based game reached 400,000 sales during its first week as an early access game. However, the benefits of the early access model have been questioned as well. For instance, the Spacebase DF-9 game abandoned the early access stage unexpectedly, disappointing many players of the game. Shortly after abandoning the early access stage and terminating the development, twelve employees were laid off including the programmer and project lead. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 1,182 Early Access Games (EAGs) on the Steam platform to understand the characteristics, advantages and limitations of the early access model. We find that 15% of the games on Steam make use of the early access model, with the most popular EAG having as many as 29 million owners. 88% of the EAGs are classified by their developers as so-called \"indie\" games, indicating that most EAGs are developed by individual developers or small studios. We study the interaction between players and developers of EAGs and the Steam platform. We observe that on the one hand, developers update their games more frequently in the early access stage. On the other hand, the percentage of players that review a game during its early access stage is lower than the percentage of players that review the game after it leaves the early access stage. However, the average rating of the reviews is much higher during the early access stage, suggesting that players are more tolerant of imperfections in the early access stage. The positive review rate does not correlate with the length or the game update frequency of the early access stage. In addition, we discuss several learned lessons from the failure of an early access game. The main learned lesson from this failure is that the communication between the game developer and the players of the EAG is crucial. Players enjoy getting involved in the development of an early access game and they get emotionally involved in the decision-making about the game. Based on our findings, we suggest game developers to use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, our findings suggest that developers can determine their release schedule without worrying about the length of the early access stage and the game update frequency during the early access stage.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Games', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Decision making', 'Schedules', 'Lead', 'Computational modeling'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer games', 'sales management', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['game developer', 'game players', 'Steam platform', 'software development process', 'consumers', 'digital distribution platforms', 'DayZ game', 'multiplayer survival-based game', 'Spacebase DF-9 game', 'employees', 'programmer', 'project lead', 'decision-making', 'EAG', 'early access stage', 'early access game', 'early access model'], 'Author Keywords ': ['early access games', 'computer games', 'Steam']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453108","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Dayi Lin;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and most recently in the Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work) incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to an app. In this paper [1], we revisit our prior finding in more depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses of 2,328 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1) developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their content, 3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses of the top ten apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue between users and developers provides valuable insights that can lead to improvements in the app store and the user support process. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Our paper is the first work to demonstrate the dynamic nature of reviews. (2) Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate a peculiar use of the app-review platforms as a user support medium. (3) In addition, our work is the first work to deeply explore developer responses in a systematic manner. (4) Finally, our classification of developer-responses highlights the value of providing canned or even automated responses in next generation app-review platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Google', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['consumer behaviour', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['free-to-download apps', 'review-response mechanism', 'mobile app reviews', 'Apple App Store', 'app developers', 'unique user feedback mechanism', 'mobile app stores', 'Google Play Store', 'free apps', 'developer-responses', 'app-review platforms', 'app owners', 'developer responses', 'negative reviews', 'review content', 'review rating', 'review increases', 'developer responding', 'user-developer', 'updated reviews', 'rudimentary user support tool'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Google Play Store', 'User-developer dialogue', 'Developer response', 'Mixed-effect model', 'Android mobile apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453075","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Safwat Hassan;Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub.

Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks.

However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

Such tools are increasingly widely adopted to improve software quality in practice. Automated Program Repair (APR) has the potential to further cut down on the cost of improving software quality. However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in real-world code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Tools', 'Static analysis', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Safety'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal verification', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification', 'software quality', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['bug-finding tools', 'static analysis', 'real-world code', 'undiscovered bugs', 'source-level patches', 'resource leaks', 'general pointer safety properties', 'program fragments', 'semantic effects', 'automated program repair technique', 'verification techniques', 'test suite', 'memory leaks', 'software quality', 'static analysis tools', 'heap properties', 'static automated Program Repair'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Separation Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453073","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rijnard van Tonder;Claire Le Goues","affiliations":";","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8823627"},{"$numberLong":"8823644"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453074","title":"[Journal First] Overfitting in Semantics-Based Automated Program Repair","abstract":"The primary goal of Automated Program Repair (APR) is to automatically fix buggy software, to reduce the manual bug-fix burden that presently rests on human developers. Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

Developers are especially active on these Q\u0026A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q\u0026A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q\u0026A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q\u0026A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q\u0026A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that (i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; (ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; (iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q\u0026A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Knowledge engineering', 'Computer science', 'Logistics', 'Analytical models', 'Mathematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['human factors', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'regression analysis', 'software engineering', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['technical questions', 'incentive systems', 'answer questions', 'rapid answering', 'Q\u0026A website', 'fast answering', 'answerer dimension', 'accepted answer', 'question dimension', 'answer dimension', 'nonfrequent answerers', 'current incentive system motivates frequent answerers', 'answer short questions', 'question answering incentive system', 'stack exchange Websites', 'answer Websites'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Q\u0026A website', 'Factor importance analysis', 'Response time']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453164","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shaowei Wang;Tse-Hsun Chen;Ahmed E.

Prior works show the feasibility of automated repair, and the research focus is gradually shifting towards the quality of generated patches. One promising direction is to control the quality of generated patches by controlling the quality of test-suites used. In this paper, we investigate the question: \"\"Can traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing be used for automated program repair?\"\". We empirically investigate the effectiveness of test-suite metrics (statement / branch coverage and mutation score) in controlling the reliability of repairs (the likelihood that repairs cause regressions). We conduct the largest-scale experiments to date with real-world software, and perform the first correlation study between test-suite metrics and the reliability of generated repairs. Our results show that by increasing test-suite metrics, the reliability of repairs tend to increase. Particularly, such trend is most strongly observed in statement coverage. This implies that traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing can also be used to improve the reliability of repairs in program repair.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Measurement', 'Correlation', 'Software reliability', 'Software', 'Software testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['regressions', 'test-suite metrics', 'automated repair', 'generated repairs', 'correlation study', 'automated program repair', 'software testing', 'test-suites', 'generated patches'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code Coverage', 'Program Repair', 'Mutation Testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453057","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jooyong Yi;Shin Hwei Tan;Sergey Mechtaev;Marcel Böhme;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions.

However, some fundamental questions, such as how new fixes overlap with old fixes, have not been investigated. Intuitively, the overlap between old and new fixes decides how APR approaches can construct new fixes with old ones. Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes. Our results show that if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the content of past fixes, only 2.1% and 3.2% new fixes can be created from single or multiple past fixes in the same project, compared with 0.9% and 1.2% fixes created from past fixes across projects. However, if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the code structure of past fixes, up to 41.3% and 29.7% new fixes can be created.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Syntactics', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['automatic program repair', 'APR approach', 'delta dependency graphs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['reusing past fix', 'empirical study', 'program repair']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453165","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hao Zhong;Na Meng","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

However, on their own, both techniques suffer from scalability problems when considering the complexity of modern software. Hybrid testing methods attempt to mitigate these problems by leveraging dynamic symbolic execution to assist fuzz testing. Unfortunately, the efficiency of such methods is still limited by specific program structures and the schedule of seed files. In this study, the authors introduce a novel lazy symbolic pointer concretisation method and a symbolic loop bucket optimisation to mitigate path explosion caused by dynamic symbolic execution in hybrid testing. They also propose a distance-based seed selection method to rearrange the seed queue of the fuzzer engine in order to achieve higher coverage. They implemented a prototype and evaluate its ability to find vulnerabilities in software and cover new execution paths. They show on different benchmarks that it can find more crashes than other off-the-shelf vulnerability detection tools.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be generated, without blocking any correct patches.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Search problems', 'Software', 'Computer crashes', 'Null value', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['automatic programming', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying patch correctness', 'test-based program repair', 'automatic program repair', 'incorrect patches', 'generated patches', 'behavior similarity', 'test case executions', 'passing tests', 'original programs', 'patched programs', 'similar runtime behavior', 'correct patches', 'program repair systems', 'jGenProg'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test based program repair', 'patch correctness', 'patch classification', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453152","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Yingfei Xiong;Xinyuan Liu;Muhan Zeng;Lu Zhang;Gang Huang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8812054"},{"$numberLong":"8805696"},{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8918958"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

By ignoring the temporal aspects of an attack during the analysis and enforcement, the state-of-the-art approaches aimed at protecting the users against such attacks are prone to have low-coverage in detection and high-disruption in prevention of permission-induced attacks. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we present TERMINATOR, a temporal permission analysis and enforcement framework for Android. Leveraging temporal logic model checking, TERMINATOR's analyzer identifies permission-induced threats with respect to dynamic permission states of the apps. At runtime, TERMINATOR's enforcer selectively leases (i.e., temporarily grants) permissions to apps when the system is in a safe state, and revokes the permissions when the system moves to an unsafe state realizing the identified threats. The results of our experiments, conducted over thousands of apps, indicate that TERMINATOR is able to provide an effective, yet non-disruptive defense against permission-induced attacks. We also show that our approach, which does not require modification to the Android framework or apps' implementation logic, is highly reliable and widely applicable.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Security', 'Informatics', 'Malware', 'Analytical models', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'authorisation', 'data privacy', 'temporal logic'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission misuse', 'temporal aspects', 'permission-induced attacks', 'temporal permission analysis', 'enforcement framework', 'temporal logic model checking', 'permission-induced threats', 'dynamic permission states', 'Android framework', 'TERMINATOR enforcer'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Access Control (Permission)', 'Temporal Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453158","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Alireza Sadeghi;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Negar Ghorbani;Hamid Bagheri;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Comput.

Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

By ignoring the temporal aspects of an attack during the analysis and enforcement, the state-of-the-art approaches aimed at protecting the users against such attacks are prone to have low-coverage in detection and high-disruption in prevention of permission-induced attacks. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we present TERMINATOR, a temporal permission analysis and enforcement framework for Android. Leveraging temporal logic model checking, TERMINATOR's analyzer identifies permission-induced threats with respect to dynamic permission states of the apps. At runtime, TERMINATOR's enforcer selectively leases (i.e., temporarily grants) permissions to apps when the system is in a safe state, and revokes the permissions when the system moves to an unsafe state realizing the identified threats. The results of our experiments, conducted over thousands of apps, indicate that TERMINATOR is able to provide an effective, yet non-disruptive defense against permission-induced attacks. We also show that our approach, which does not require modification to the Android framework or apps' implementation logic, is highly reliable and widely applicable.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Security', 'Informatics', 'Malware', 'Analytical models', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'authorisation', 'data privacy', 'temporal logic'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission misuse', 'temporal aspects', 'permission-induced attacks', 'temporal permission analysis', 'enforcement framework', 'temporal logic model checking', 'permission-induced threats', 'dynamic permission states', 'Android framework', 'TERMINATOR enforcer'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Access Control (Permission)', 'Temporal Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453158","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Alireza Sadeghi;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Negar Ghorbani;Hamid Bagheri;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Comput.

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Unfortunately, developing efficient ORM applications is challenging, as the ORM framework hides the underlying database query generation and execution. This problem is becoming more severe as these applications need to process an increasingly large amount of persistent data. Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance anti-patterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them. In this paper, we try to answer these questions through a comprehensive study of 12 representative real-world ORM applications. We generalize 9 ORM performance anti-patterns from more than 200 performance issues that we obtain by studying their bug-tracking systems and profiling their latest versions. To prove our point, we manually fix 64 performance issues in their latest versions and obtain a median speedup of 2 (and up to 39 max) with fewer than 5 lines of code change in most cases. Many of the issues we found have been confirmed by developers, and we have implemented ways to identify other code fragments with similar issues as well.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Rails', 'Scalability', 'Servers', 'Indexes', 'Computer bugs', 'Semantics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'program debugging', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'relational databases'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['persistent data storage', 'efficient ORM applications', 'ORM framework hides', 'underlying database query generation', 'performance problems', 'common performance anti-patterns', 'resulting application performance', 'real-world ORM applications', '200 performance issues', 'performance bugs', 'object relational mapping frameworks', 'database-backed Web applications', 'ORM performance anti-patterns'], 'Author Keywords ': ['performance anti-patterns', 'Object-Relational Mapping frameworks', 'database-backed applications', 'bug study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453153","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Junwen Yang;Cong Yan;Pranav Subramaniam;Shan Lu;Alvin Cheung","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811938"},{"$numberLong":"8952177"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

Consequently, familiarity is an important factor in many contexts of software development, especially for maintenance and program comprehension. As a result, familiarity is considered to some extent in many different approaches, for example, to model costs or to identify experts. Still, all approaches we are aware of require a manual assessment of familiarity and empirical analyses of forgetting in software development are missing. In this paper, we address this issue with an empirical study that we conducted with 60 open-source developers. We used a survey to receive information on the developers' familiarity and analyze the responses based on data we extract from their used version control systems. The results show that forgetting is an important factor when considering familiarity and program comprehension of developers. We find that a forgetting curve is partly applicable for software development, investigate three factors - the number of edits, ratio of owned code, and tracking behavior - that can impact familiarity with code, and derive a general memory strength for our participants. Our findings can be used to scope approaches that have to consider familiarity and they provide insights into forgetting in the context of software development.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Task analysis', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Psychology', 'Software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['configuration management', 'software development management', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'software development', 'owned code', 'open-source developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['familiarity', 'forgetting', 'empirical study', 'maintenance', 'program comprehension', 'expert identification', 'knowledge management']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453149","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jacob Krüger;Jens Wiemann;Wolfram Fenske;Gunter Saake;Thomas Leich","affiliations":"Harz Univ. of Appl.

These software professionals found tool/infrastructure barriers in 7% to 71% of the use-case steps that they analyzed, most of which are tied to newcomer barriers that have been established in the literature.

When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil\u0026Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We assume that software development proceeds as a series of changes and model the probability that a change to software will cause a failure. We use predictors based on the properties of a change itself. Such predictors include size in lines of code added, deleted, and unmodified; diffusion of the change and its component subchanges, as reflected in the number of files, modules, and subsystems touched, or changed; several measures of developer experience; and the type of change and its subchanges (fault fixes or new code). The model is built on historic information and is used to predict the risk of new changes. In this paper we apply the model to 5ESS software updates and find that change diffusion and developer experience are essential to predicting failures. The predictive model is implemented as a Web-based tool to allow timely prediction of change quality. The ability to predict the quality of change enables us to make appropriate decisions regarding inspection, testing, and delivery.

With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

However, some fundamental questions, such as how new fixes overlap with old fixes, have not been investigated. Intuitively, the overlap between old and new fixes decides how APR approaches can construct new fixes with old ones. Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes. Our results show that if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the content of past fixes, only 2.1% and 3.2% new fixes can be created from single or multiple past fixes in the same project, compared with 0.9% and 1.2% fixes created from past fixes across projects.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play.

Although various empirical and analytical comparisons for some ATC prioritisation (ATCP) techniques have been conducted, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no comparative study focusing on the most current techniques has yet been reported. In this study, they investigated 18 ATCP techniques, categorised into four classes.

A great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager.

Why Licensing Bugs Matter","abstract":"Software licenses dictate how source code or binaries can be modified, reused, and redistributed. In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s). Developers and organizations can also modify existing licenses, creating custom licenses with specific permissive/restrictive terms. Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities. Our findings uncover new types of licensing bugs not addressed in prior literature, and a detailed assessment of their implications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses', 'Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Law', 'Guidelines', 'Stakeholders'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software projects', 'software licenses', 'custom licenses', 'software developers', 'license incompatibilities', 'licensing bug developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software Licenses', 'Empirical Studies', 'Open Source Practices']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453086","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Vendome;Daniel German;Massimiliano Di Penta;Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia;Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8930891"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453159","title":"Global-Aware Recommendations for Repairing Violations in Exception Handling","abstract":"This paper presents an extended abstract incorporated as a journalrst paper into the ICSE'18 program.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Software engineering', 'Software maintenance', 'Java', 'Tools', 'Recommender systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['exception handling', 'object-oriented programming', 'program diagnostics', 'recommender systems'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['global-aware recommendations', 'repairing violations', 'journalrst paper', 'exception handling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Exception Handling', 'Recommender system', 'Software maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453159","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Eiji Adachi Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia","affiliations":"Digital Metropolis Inst., UFRN, Natal, Brazil;Inf.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting crowdsourced opinions mined from Stack Overflow (e.g., what is the sentiment of developers about the usability of a library). To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning.

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and De-fects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also found that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we found that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Fault detection', 'Correlation', 'Java', 'Measurement', 'Software testing', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mutation score', 'randomly selected test suites', 'higher mutation scores', 'mutation scores correlated', 'real fault detection', 'scale empirical study', 'empirical validation', 'software testing studies', 'mutant scores', 'test suite size', 'dependent variable the detection', 'fault detection capability'], 'Author Keywords ': ['mutation testing', 'real faults', 'test suite effectiveness']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mike Papadakis;Donghwan Shin;Shin Yoo;Doo-Hwan Bae","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730152"},{"$numberLong":"8735019"},{"$numberLong":"8919245"},{"$numberLong":"8952421"},{"$numberLong":"8705674"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as \"printf debugging\" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Instruments', 'Interviews', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer debugging', 'program debugging', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['integrated development environments', 'debugging experts', 'regular debugging users', 'printf debugging', 'advanced debugging features', 'software projects', 'software engineers debug software problems', 'debugging tools', 'mixed-methods research approach'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Testing', 'WatchDog', 'IntelliJ', 'Eclipse']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453125","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Moritz Beller;Niels Spruit;Diomidis Spinellis;Andy Zaidman","affiliations":"Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Athens Univ. of Econ. \u0026 Bus., Athens, Greece;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8727527"},{"$numberLong":"8945610"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8789793","title":"Live interactive queries to a software application's memory profile","abstract":"Memory operations are critical to an application's reliability and performance.

However, writing and maintaining high-quality test code is challenging and frequently considered of secondary importance. For production code, many open source and industrial software projects employ code review, a well-established software quality practice, but the question remains whether and how code review is also used for ensuring the quality of test code. The aim of this research is to answer this question and to increase our understanding of what developers think and do when it comes to reviewing test code. We conducted both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze more than 300,000 code reviews, and interviewed 12 developers about how they review test files. This work resulted in an overview of current code reviewing practices, a set of identified obstacles limiting the review of test code, and a set of issues that developers would like to see improved in code review tools. The study reveals that reviewing test files is very different from reviewing production files, and that the navigation within the review itself is one of the main issues developers currently face.

However, the code snippets in such a forum often contain undeclared, ambiguous, or largely unqualified external references. Such declaration ambiguity and external reference ambiguity present challenges for developers in learning to correctly use the APIs. In this paper, we propose StatType, a statistical approach to resolve the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the API elements in such code snippets. Unlike existing approaches that are based on heuristics, StatType has two well-integrated factors. We first learn from a large training code corpus the FQNs that often co-occur. Then, to derive the FQN for an API name in a code snippet, we use that knowledge and leverage the context consisting of neighboring API names. To realize those factors, we treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that StatType achieves very high accuracy with 97.6% precision and 96.7% recall, which is 16.5% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computational modeling', 'Software libraries', 'Training', 'Software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Internet', 'language translation', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'software libraries', 'statistical analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['machine translation', 'StackOverflow posts', 'API fully qualified names', 'statistical learning', 'partially qualified names', 'source code', 'API name', 'training code corpus', 'API elements', 'FQNs', 'statistical approach', 'StatType', 'external reference', 'declaration ambiguity', 'code snippet', 'software libraries', 'online forums', 'software developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Type Resolution', 'Type Inference', 'Type Annotations', 'Partial Program Analysis', 'Statistical Machine Translation', 'Naturalness', 'Big Code']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453132","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hung Phan;Hoan Anh Nguyen;Ngoc M.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks.

However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

Why Licensing Bugs Matter","abstract":"Software licenses dictate how source code or binaries can be modified, reused, and redistributed. In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s). Developers and organizations can also modify existing licenses, creating custom licenses with specific permissive/restrictive terms. Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities. Our findings uncover new types of licensing bugs not addressed in prior literature, and a detailed assessment of their implications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses', 'Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Law', 'Guidelines', 'Stakeholders'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software projects', 'software licenses', 'custom licenses', 'software developers', 'license incompatibilities', 'licensing bug developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software Licenses', 'Empirical Studies', 'Open Source Practices']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453086","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Vendome;Daniel German;Massimiliano Di Penta;Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia;Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8930891"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Specifically, we ran word2vec on a collection of over 20 million documents from Stack Overflow, thus obtaining word vectors that are representative of developers' communication style. The classifier is trained and validated using a gold standard of 4,423 Stack Overflow posts, including questions, answers, and comments, which were manually annotated for sentiment polarity. We release the full lab package, which includes both the gold standard and the emotion annotation guidelines, to ease the execution of replications as well as new studies on emotion awareness in software engineering. To inform future research on word embedding for text categorization and information retrieval in software engineering, the replication kit also includes the DSM. Results. The contribution of the lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features is assessed by our empirical evaluation leveraging different feature settings. With respect to SentiStrength, a mainstream off-the-shelf tool that we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence of better performance also in presence of a minimal set of training documents.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Collaboration', 'Programming'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'information retrieval', 'pattern classification', 'sentiment analysis', 'social networking (online)', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['keyword-based features', 'sentiment polarity detection', 'empirical software engineering', 'distributional semantic model', 'DSM', 'stack overflow', 'emotion annotation guidelines', 'text categorization', 'information retrieval', 'replication kit', 'sentistrength', 'word embedding', 'software developers emotions', 'crowd-generated content mining', 'lexicon-based features', 'software developers communication channels', 'word vectors', 'sentiment polarity classifier', 'software engineering domain', 'problem reports', 'technical jargon', 'general-purpose social media', 'nontechnical domains', 'off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools', 'information sources', 'software repositories', 'software development', 'Senti4SD', 'semantic features'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Sentiment Analysis', 'Communication Channels', 'Stack Overflow', 'Word Embedding', 'Social Software Engineering']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453070","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Calefato;Filippo Lanubile;Federico Maiorano;Nicole Novielli","affiliations":"Univ. of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy;Univ. of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy;Univ. of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy;Univ. of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Recent work in this area has shown potential to save programmer time and reduce the risk of defects. Existing techniques focus on data structures for manipulating subsets of a single collection, but real-world programs often track multiple related collections and aggregate properties such as sums, counts, minimums, and maximums. This paper shows how to synthesize data structures that track subsets and aggregations of multiple related collections. Our technique decomposes the synthesis task into alternating steps of query synthesis and incrementalization. The query synthesis step implements pure operations over the data structure state by leveraging existing enumerative synthesis techniques, specialized to the data structures domain. The incrementalization step implements imperative state modifications by re-framing them as fresh queries that determine what to change, coupled with a small amount of code to apply the change. As an added benefit of this approach over previous work, the synthesized data structure is optimized for not only the queries in the specification but also the required update operations. We have evaluated our approach in four large case studies, demonstrating that these extensions are broadly applicable.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data structures', 'Synthesizers', 'Task analysis', 'Software', 'Servers', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data structures', 'query processing', 'reasoning about programs', 'set theory'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['data structure implementations', 'track subsets', 'incrementalization', 'data structure state', 'data structures domain', 'data structure synthesis', 'query synthesis', 'aggregations', 're-framing', 'code'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program synthesis', 'automatic programming', 'data structures']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453175","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Calvin Loncaric;Michael D.

App reviews provide an opportunity to proactively collect user complaints and promptly improve apps' user experience, in terms of bug fixing and feature refinement. However, the tremendous quantities of reviews and noise words (e.g., misspelled words) increase the difficulties in accurately identifying newly-appearing app issues. In this paper, we propose a novel and automated framework IDEA, which aims to IDentify Emerging App issues effectively based on online review analysis. We evaluate IDEA on six popular apps from Google Play and Apple's App Store, employing the official app changelogs as our ground truth. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of IDEA in identifying emerging app issues. Feedback from engineers and product managers shows that 88.9% of them think that the identified issues can facilitate app development in practice.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Such tools are increasingly widely adopted to improve software quality in practice. Automated Program Repair (APR) has the potential to further cut down on the cost of improving software quality. However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in real-world code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Tools', 'Static analysis', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Safety'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal verification', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification', 'software quality', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['bug-finding tools', 'static analysis', 'real-world code', 'undiscovered bugs', 'source-level patches', 'resource leaks', 'general pointer safety properties', 'program fragments', 'semantic effects', 'automated program repair technique', 'verification techniques', 'test suite', 'memory leaks', 'software quality', 'static analysis tools', 'heap properties', 'static automated Program Repair'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Separation Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453073","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rijnard van Tonder;Claire Le Goues","affiliations":";","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8823627"},{"$numberLong":"8823644"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453074","title":"[Journal First] Overfitting in Semantics-Based Automated Program Repair","abstract":"The primary goal of Automated Program Repair (APR) is to automatically fix buggy software, to reduce the manual bug-fix burden that presently rests on human developers. Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

Although benchmark sets are used widely throughout computer science, existing benchmarks are not easily adapted to the problem of automatic defect repair, which has several special requirements. Most important of these is the need for benchmark programs with reproducible, important defects and a deterministic method for assessing if those defects have been repaired. This article details the need for a new set of benchmarks, outlines requirements, and then presents two datasets, ManyBugs and IntroClass, consisting between them of 1,183 defects in 15 C programs. Each dataset is designed to support the comparative evaluation of automatic repair algorithms asking a variety of experimental questions. The datasets have empirically defined guarantees of reproducibility and benchmark quality, and each study object is categorized to facilitate qualitative evaluation and comparisons by category of bug or program. The article presents baseline experimental results on both datasets for three existing repair methods, GenProg, AE, and TrpAutoRepair, to reduce the burden on researchers who adopt these datasets for their own comparative evaluations.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Benchmark testing', 'Computer bugs', 'Software systems', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['benchmark testing', 'C language', 'program debugging', 'software maintenance', 'software performance evaluation', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['TrpAutoRepair', 'GenProg', 'qualitative evaluation', 'benchmark quality', 'reproducibility', 'automatic repair algorithms', 'defects assessment', 'deterministic method', 'benchmark programs', 'automatic defect repair', 'computer science', 'benchmark sets', 'benchmark problems', 'automated software repair', 'C programs', 'IntroClass benchmarks', 'ManyBugs benchmarks'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated program repair', 'benchmark', 'subject defect', 'reproducibility', 'ManyBugs', 'IntroClass']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7153570","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":10,"year":2015,"authors":"Claire Le Goues;Neal Holtschulte;Edward K.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453120","title":"[Journal First] ChangeLocator: Locate Crash-Inducing Changes Based on Crash Reports","abstract":"Software crashes are severe manifestations of software bugs. Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These performance tests often consume large amounts of computing resources and time since heavy loads need to be generated. Making it worse, the ever evolving eld requires frequent updates to the performance testing environment. In practice, virtual machines (VMs) are widely exploited to provide exible and less costly environments for performance tests. However, the use of VMs may introduce confounding overhead (e.g., a higher than expected memory utilization with unstable I/O tra c) to the testing environment and lead to unre-alistic performance testing results. Yet, little research has studied the impact on test results of using VMs in performance testing activities. To evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing results from virtual and physical environments, we perform a case study on two open source systems - namely Dell DVD Store (DS2) and CloudStore. We conduct the same performance tests in both virtual and physical environments and compare the performance testing results based on the three aspects that are typically examined for performance testing results: 1) single performance metric (e.g. CPU Time from virtual environment vs. CPU Time from physical environment), 2) the relationship among performance metrics (e.g. correlation between CPU and I/O) and 3) performance models that are built to predict system performance. Our results show that 1) A single metric from virtual and physical environments do not follow the same distribution, hence practitioners cannot simply use a scaling factor to compare the performance between environments, 2) correlations among performance metrics in virtual environments are different from those in physical environments 3) statistical models built based on the performance metrics from virtual environments are different from the models built from physical environments suggesting that practitioners cannot use the performance testing results across virtual and physical environments. In order to assist the practitioners leverage performance testing results in both environments, we investigate ways to reduce the discrepancy. We find that such discrepancy can be reduced by normalizing performance metrics based on deviance. Overall, we suggest that practitioners should not use the performance testing results from virtual environment with the simple assumption of straightforward performance overhead. Instead, practitioners should consider leveraging normalization techniques to reduce the discrepancy before examining performance testing results from virtual and physical environments.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Measurement', 'Software engineering', 'Virtual environments', 'Correlation', 'Software performance'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'public domain software', 'software metrics', 'statistical analysis', 'virtual machines'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['performance metrics', 'performance testing environment', 'unre-alistic performance testing results', 'performance testing activities', 'physical environments', 'software systems', 'open source systems', 'Dell DVD store', 'CloudStore', 'practitioners leverage performance testing', 'virtual environments', 'scaling factor', 'statistical models'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software performance engineering', 'Software performance analysis', 'Testing on virtual environments']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453155","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Muhammad Moiz Arif;Weiyi Shang;Emad Shihab","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

JIT models are trained using techniques that assume that past fix-inducing changes are similar to future ones. However, this assumption may not hold, e.g., as system complexity tends to accrue, expertise may become more important as systems age. In this paper, we study JIT models as systems evolve. Through a longitudinal case study of 37,524 changes from the rapidly evolving Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that fluctuations in the properties of fix-inducing changes can impact the performance and interpretation of JIT models. More specifically: (a) the discriminatory power (AUC) and calibration (Brier) scores of JIT models drop considerably one year after being trained; (b) the role that code change properties (e.g., Size, Experience) play within JIT models fluctuates over time; and (c) those fluctuations yield over- and underestimates of the future impact of code change properties on the likelihood of inducing fixes. To avoid erroneous or misleading predictions, JIT models should be retrained using recently recorded data (within three months). Moreover, quality improvement plans should be informed by JIT models that are trained using six months (or more) of historical data, since they are more resilient to period-specific fluctuations in the importance of code change properties.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Predictive models', 'History', 'Fluctuations', 'Training', 'Data models', 'Software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'just-in-time', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'public domain software', 'software fault tolerance', 'software management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['fix-inducing changes', 'JIT models', 'just-in-time models', 'just-in-time defect prediction', 'Qt systems', 'OpenStack systems', 'fix-inducing code changes', 'code change properties'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Just In Time prediction', 'Defect prediction', 'Mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453123","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shane McIntosh;Yasutaka Kamei","affiliations":"McGill Univ., Montréal, QC, Canada;Kyushu Univ., Fukuoka, Japan","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816772"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This popularity coupled with user data collection by Android apps has made privacy protection a well-known challenge in the Android ecosystem. In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

The simultaneous presence of these bugs may deteriorate the effectiveness of existing fault-localization techniques to locate program bugs. While it is acceptable to use all failed and successful tests to identify suspicious code for programs with exactly one bug, it is not appropriate to use the same approach for programs with multiple bugs because the due-to relationship between failed tests and underlying bugs cannot be easily identified. One solution is to generate fault-focused clusters by grouping failed tests caused by the same bug into the same clusters. We propose MSeer - an advanced fault localization technique for locating multiple bugs in parallel. Our major contributions include the use of (1) a revised Kendall tau distance to measure the distance between two failed tests, (2) an innovative approach to simultaneously estimate the number of clusters and assign initial medoids to these clusters, and (3) an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm to better identify the due-to relationship between failed tests and their corresponding bugs.

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

To instantiate this approach, we build GitSearch, a code search engine, on top of GitHub and Stack Overflow Q\u0026A data. We evaluate GitSearch in several dimensions to demonstrate that (1) its code search results are correct with respect to user-accepted answers; (2) the results are qualitatively better than those of existing Internet-scale code search engines; (3) our engine is competitive against web search engines, such as Google, in helping users solve programming tasks; and (4) GitSearch provides code examples that are acceptable or interesting to the community as answers for Stack Overflow questions.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Search engines', 'Software engineering', 'Vocabulary', 'Indexes', 'Programming', 'Engines', 'Natural languages'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'query processing', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'search engines'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structuring user queries', 'source code terms', 'search query', 'vocabulary mismatch problem', 'free-form code search queries', 'structural code entities', 'code repositories', 'GitSearch', 'user-accepted answers', 'web search engines', 'Internet-scale code search engines', 'expert answers', 'code vocabulary', 'CoCaBu', 'developer questions', 'stack overflow Q and A data', 'Google', 'programming tasks', 'user queries augmentation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code search', 'GitHub', 'Free form search', 'Query augmentation', 'StackOverflow', 'Vocabulary mismatch']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453173","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Raphael Sirres;Tegawendé F.

Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Tools', 'Java', 'Runtime', 'Open source software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['hybrid RTS approach', 'granularity RTS', 'selected test ratio', 'offline testing time', 'method-level changes', 'instance method additions/deletions', 'file-level changes', 'online testing time', 'code changes', 'RTS techniques', 'hybrid regression test selection', 'regression testing cost reduction', 'HyRTS technique', 'FRTS'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test selection', 'Regression testing', 'Dynamic analysis', 'Empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453079","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingming Zhang","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730161"},{"$numberLong":"8730207"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8804429"},{"$numberLong":"8812109"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8812033"},{"$numberLong":"8854715"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub.

Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively.

This popularity coupled with user data collection by Android apps has made privacy protection a well-known challenge in the Android ecosystem. In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

Their result is drawn from a large-scale empirical analysis on the localisation effectiveness with respect to randomly sampled test suites.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In this paper, we investigate how and why quasi-contributors (external developers who did not succeed in getting their contributions accepted to an OSS project) fail. To achieve our goal, we collected data from 21 popular, non-trivial GitHub projects, identified quasi-contributors, and analyzed their pull-requests. In addition, we conducted surveys with quasi-contributors, and projects' integrators, to understand their perceptions about nonacceptance.We found 10,099 quasi-contributors - about 70% of the total actual contributors - that submitted 12,367 non-accepted pull-requests. In five projects, we found more quasi-contributors than actual contributors. About one-third of the developers who took our survey disagreed with the nonacceptance, and around 30% declared the nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request. The main reasons for pull-request nonacceptance from the quasi-contributors' perspective were \"superseded/duplicated pull-request\" and \"mismatch between developer's and team's vision/opinion.\" A manual analysis of a representative sample of 263 pull-requests corroborated with this finding. We also found reasons related to the relationship with the community and lack of experience or commitment from the quasi-contributors. This empirical study is particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers' participation and retention in OSS communities.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Open source software', 'Computer languages', 'Software engineering', 'Face', 'Analytical models', 'Encoding'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['project management', 'public domain software', 'software management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['OSS project', 'open-source software projects', 'manual analysis', 'quasicontributors', 'GitHub projects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['pull-requests', 'quasi contributors', 'newcomers', 'open source software']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453084","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Igor Steinmacher;Gustavo Pinto;Igor Scaliante Wiese;Marco Aurélio Gerosa","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8797633"},{"$numberLong":"8802111"},{"$numberLong":"8811892"},{"$numberLong":"8816766"},{"$numberLong":"8823598"},{"$numberLong":"8935866"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453116","title":"How Modern News Aggregators Help Development Communities Shape and Share Knowledge","abstract":"Many developers rely on modern news aggregator sites such as reddit and hn to stay up to date with the latest technological developments and trends.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These performance tests often consume large amounts of computing resources and time since heavy loads need to be generated. Making it worse, the ever evolving eld requires frequent updates to the performance testing environment. In practice, virtual machines (VMs) are widely exploited to provide exible and less costly environments for performance tests. However, the use of VMs may introduce confounding overhead (e.g., a higher than expected memory utilization with unstable I/O tra c) to the testing environment and lead to unre-alistic performance testing results. Yet, little research has studied the impact on test results of using VMs in performance testing activities. To evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing results from virtual and physical environments, we perform a case study on two open source systems - namely Dell DVD Store (DS2) and CloudStore. We conduct the same performance tests in both virtual and physical environments and compare the performance testing results based on the three aspects that are typically examined for performance testing results: 1) single performance metric (e.g. CPU Time from virtual environment vs. CPU Time from physical environment), 2) the relationship among performance metrics (e.g. correlation between CPU and I/O) and 3) performance models that are built to predict system performance. Our results show that 1) A single metric from virtual and physical environments do not follow the same distribution, hence practitioners cannot simply use a scaling factor to compare the performance between environments, 2) correlations among performance metrics in virtual environments are different from those in physical environments 3) statistical models built based on the performance metrics from virtual environments are different from the models built from physical environments suggesting that practitioners cannot use the performance testing results across virtual and physical environments. In order to assist the practitioners leverage performance testing results in both environments, we investigate ways to reduce the discrepancy. We find that such discrepancy can be reduced by normalizing performance metrics based on deviance. Overall, we suggest that practitioners should not use the performance testing results from virtual environment with the simple assumption of straightforward performance overhead. Instead, practitioners should consider leveraging normalization techniques to reduce the discrepancy before examining performance testing results from virtual and physical environments.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Measurement', 'Software engineering', 'Virtual environments', 'Correlation', 'Software performance'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'public domain software', 'software metrics', 'statistical analysis', 'virtual machines'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['performance metrics', 'performance testing environment', 'unre-alistic performance testing results', 'performance testing activities', 'physical environments', 'software systems', 'open source systems', 'Dell DVD store', 'CloudStore', 'practitioners leverage performance testing', 'virtual environments', 'scaling factor', 'statistical models'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software performance engineering', 'Software performance analysis', 'Testing on virtual environments']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453155","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Muhammad Moiz Arif;Weiyi Shang;Emad Shihab","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil\u0026Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s).

Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities.

In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

As such, Data Intensive (DI) applications are becoming more and more important and critical. They must be fault-tolerant, they should scale with the amount of data, and be able to elastically leverage additional resources as and when these last ones are provided [3]. Moreover, they should be able to avoid data drops introduced in case of sudden overloads and should offer some Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Ensuring all these properties is, per se, a challenge, but it becomes even more difficult for DI applications, given the large amount of data to be managed and the significant level of parallelism required for its components. Even if today some technological frameworks are available for the development of such applications (for instance, think of Spark, Storm, Flink), we still lack solid software engineering approaches to support their development and, in particular, to ensure that they offer the required properties in terms of availability, throughput, data loss, etc. In fact, at the time of writing, identifying the right solution can require several rounds of experiments and the adoption of many different technologies. This implies the need for highly skilled persons and the execution of experiments with large data sets and a large number of resources, and, consequently, a significant amount of time and budget. To experiment with currently available approaches, we performed an action research experiment focusing on developing- testing-reengineering a specific DI application, Hegira4Cloud, that migrates data between widely used NoSQL databases, including so-called Database as a Service (DaaS), as well as on-premise databases. This is a representative DI system because it has to handle large volumes of data with different structures and has to guarantee that some important characteristics, in terms of data types and transactional properties, are preserved. Also, it poses stringent requirements in terms of correctness, high performance, fault tolerance, and fast and effective recovery. In our action research, we discovered that the literature offered some high level design guidelines for DI applications, as well as some tools to support modelling and QoS analysis/simulation of complex architectures, however the available tools were not yet. suitable to support DI systems. Moreover, we realized that the available big data frameworks we could have used were not flexible enough to cope with all possible application-specific aspects of our system. Hence, to achieve the desired level of performance, fault tolerance and recovery, we had to adopt a time-consuming, experiment-based approach [1, 6], which, in our case, consisted of three iterations: (1) the design and implementation of a Mediation Data Model capable of managing data extracted from different databases, together with a first monholitical prototype of Hegira4Cloud; (2) the improvement of performance of our prototype when managing and transferring huge amounts of data; (3) the introduction of fault-tolerant data extraction and management mechanisms, which are independent from the targeted databases. Among the others, an important issue that has forced us to reiterate in the development of Hegira4Cloud concerned the DaaS we interfaced with. In particular these DaaS, which are well-known services with a large number of users: (1) were missing detailed information regarding the behaviour of their APIs; (2) did not offer a predictable service; (3) were suffering of random downtimes not correlated with the datasets we were experimenting with. In this journal first presentation, we describe our experience and the issues we encountered that led to some important decisions during the software design and engineering process. Also, we analyse the state of the art of software design and verification tools and approaches in the light of our experience, and identify weaknesses, alternative design approaches and open challenges that could generate new research in these areas.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, current approaches either do not account for correlations between object fields or do so in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we introduce the problem of composite constant propagation. We develop the first generic solver that infers all possible values of complex objects in an interprocedural, flow and context-sensitive manner, taking field correlations into account. Composite constant propagation problems are specified using COAL, a declarative language. We apply our COAL solver to the problem of inferring Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) values, which is required to understand how the components of Android applications interact. Using COAL, we model ICC objects in Android more thoroughly than the state-of-the-art. We compute ICC values for 460 applications from the Play store. The ICC values we infer are substantially more precise than previous work. The analysis is efficient, taking slightly over two minutes per application on average. While this work can be used as the basis for many whole-program analyses of Android applications, the COAL solver can also be used to infer the values of composite objects in many other contexts.","conference":"IEEE/ACM IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Coal', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Data models', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['mobile computing', 'program diagnostics', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['composite constant propagation', 'Android application', 'intercomponent communication analysis', 'ICC', 'program analysis', 'COAL solver', 'declarative language'], 'Author Keywords ': ['inter-component communication', 'composite constant', 'constant propagation', 'Android', 'Android IPC', 'Android ICC']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194563","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Damien Octeau;Daniel Luchaup;Matthew Dering;Somesh Jha;Patrick McDaniel","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

We introduce a new pointer-analysis-based static analysis, CRed, for finding UAF bugs in multi-MLOC C source code efficiently and effectively. Cred achieves this by making three advances: (i) a spatio-temporal context reduction technique for scaling down soundly and precisely the exponential number of contexts that would otherwise be considered at a pair of free and use sites, (ii) a multi-stage analysis for filtering out false alarms efficiently, and (iii) a path-sensitive demand-driven approach for finding the points-to information required. We have implemented CRed in LLVM-3.8.0 and compared it with four different state-of-the-art static tools: CBMC (model checking), Clang (abstract interpretation), Coccinelle (pattern matching), and Supa (pointer analysis) using all the C test cases in Juliet Test Suite (JTS) and 10 open-source C applications. For the ground-truth validated with JTS, CRed detects all the 138 known UAF bugs as CBMC and Supa do while Clang and Coccinelle miss some bugs, with no false alarms from any tool. For practicality validated with the 10 applications (totaling 3+ MLOC), CRed reports 132 warnings including 85 bugs in 7.6 hours while the existing tools are either unscalable by terminating within 3 days only for one application (CBMC) or impractical by finding virtually no bugs (Clang and Coccinelle) or issuing an excessive number of false alarms (Supa).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Correlation', 'Australia', 'Pattern matching', 'Software', 'Static analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['C language', 'pattern matching', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Coccinelle', 'false alarms', 'pointer-analysis-based static approach', 'zero-day Use-After-Free vulnerabilities', 'pointer-analysis-based static analysis', 'finding UAF bugs', 'multiMLOC C source code', 'spatio-temporal context reduction technique', 'multistage analysis', 'path-sensitive demand-driven approach', 'CBMC', 'Supa', 'Juliet Test Suite', 'open-source C applications', 'UAF bugs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['use after free', 'program analysis', 'bug detection']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453091","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hua Yan;Yulei Sui;Shiping Chen;Jingling Xue","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance. We then evaluate each approach in 2,135 queries extracted from three open source software and one industrial software system. Our results show that GA is able to completely cover 98.6% of all queries in the dataset, requiring only a few seconds per query. Moreover, it does not suffer from the limitations affecting state-of-the art techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Databases', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Search problems', 'Structured Query Language', 'Toy manufacturing industry', 'Software systems', 'Engines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['database management systems', 'genetic algorithms', 'program testing', 'query processing', 'search problems', 'SQL'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['SQL query', 'complex queries', 'model test data generation', 'physical query plan', 'Search-Based Test Data Generation', 'database-centric systems', 'SQL queries', 'SQL commands', 'constraint satisfaction problem', 'search-based problem', 'biased random search', 'genetic algorithms', 'database engine', 'search guidance', 'open source software', 'industrial software system'], 'Author Keywords ': ['search based software engineering', 'automated test data generation', 'SQL', 'databases']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453204","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jeroen Castelein;Maurício Aniche;Mozhan Soltani;Annibale Panichella;Arie van Deursen","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812175"},{"$numberLong":"8919030"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453146","title":"[Journal First] The Scent of a Smell: An Extensive Comparison Between Textual and Structural Smells","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design or implementation choices that have a negative effect on several aspects of software maintenance and evolution, such as program comprehension or change-and fault-proneness. This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

These tools have been shown to be effective in achieving good test coverage and in finding bugs without human intervention. Being automated, these tools typically run for a long time (say, for several hours), either until they saturate test coverage or until a testing time budget expires. Thus, these automated tools are not good at generating concise regression test suites that could be used for testing in incremental development of the apps and in regression testing. We propose a heuristic technique that helps create a small regression test suite for an Android app from a large test suite generated by an automated Android GUI testing tool. The key insight behind our technique is that if we can identify and remove some common forms of redundancies introduced by existing automated GUI testing tools, then we can drastically lower the time required to minimize a GUI test suite. We have implemented our algorithm in a prototype tool called DetReduce. We applied DetReduce to several Android apps and found that DetReduce reduces a test-suite by an average factor of16.9 in size and14.7 in running time. We also found that for a test suite generated by running SwiftHand and a randomized test generation algorithm for 8 hours, DetReduce minimizes the test suite in an average of 14.6 hours.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Testing', 'Tools', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Redundancy', 'Computer bugs'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'graphical user interfaces', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android GUI test suites', 'randomized test generation algorithm', 'GUI test suite', 'testing tools', 'automated Android GUI testing tool', 'regression test suite', 'concise regression test suites', 'automated tools', 'testing time budget', 'Android app', 'automated GUI testing techniques', 'regression testing', 'DetReduce'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'GUI', 'Test minimization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453105","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wontae Choi;Koushik Sen;George Necul;Wenyu Wang","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA;Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8753481"},{"$numberLong":"8812132"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453122","title":"Efficient Sampling of SAT Solutions for Testing","abstract":"In software and hardware testing, generating multiple inputs which satisfy a given set of constraints is an important problem with applications in fuzz testing and stimulus generation.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic. Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE. Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques. Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Analytical models', 'Unified modeling language', 'Stakeholders', 'Collaborative software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'groupware', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collaborative model-driven software engineering', 'CoSE', 'UML-based approach', 'decision making', 'understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches', 'model-driven engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Collaborative MDSE', 'CoMDSE', 'C MDSE', 'model driven engineering', 'collaborative software engineering', 'CoSE', 'systematic mapping study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453119","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Davide Di Ruscio;Mirco Franzago;Ivano Malavolta;Henry Muccini","affiliations":"DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;Vrije Univ.

Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Tools', 'Java', 'Runtime', 'Open source software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['hybrid RTS approach', 'granularity RTS', 'selected test ratio', 'offline testing time', 'method-level changes', 'instance method additions/deletions', 'file-level changes', 'online testing time', 'code changes', 'RTS techniques', 'hybrid regression test selection', 'regression testing cost reduction', 'HyRTS technique', 'FRTS'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test selection', 'Regression testing', 'Dynamic analysis', 'Empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453079","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingming Zhang","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730161"},{"$numberLong":"8730207"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8804429"},{"$numberLong":"8812109"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8812033"},{"$numberLong":"8854715"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

A Large Scale Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults","abstract":"Empirical validation of software testing studies is increasingly relying on mutants. This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and De-fects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also found that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we found that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Fault detection', 'Correlation', 'Java', 'Measurement', 'Software testing', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mutation score', 'randomly selected test suites', 'higher mutation scores', 'mutation scores correlated', 'real fault detection', 'scale empirical study', 'empirical validation', 'software testing studies', 'mutant scores', 'test suite size', 'dependent variable the detection', 'fault detection capability'], 'Author Keywords ': ['mutation testing', 'real faults', 'test suite effectiveness']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mike Papadakis;Donghwan Shin;Shin Yoo;Doo-Hwan Bae","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730152"},{"$numberLong":"8735019"},{"$numberLong":"8919245"},{"$numberLong":"8952421"},{"$numberLong":"8705674"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In C++, one place developers can find documentation is in a header file. When information is missing, they may look at the corresponding implementation code. To understand what's missing from C++ API documentation and the factors influencing whether it will be fixed, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving two experience sampling surveys with hundreds of developers at the moment they visited implementation code, interviews with 18 of those developers, and interviews with 8 API maintainers.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play.

Here, the programmer starts by writing a \"draft\" that mixes un nished code, natural language comments, and correctness requirements. A program synthesizer that interacts with a large, searchable database of program snippets is used to automatically complete the draft into a program that meets the re-quirements. The synthesis process happens in two stages. First, the synthesizer identi es a small number of programs in the database that are relevant to the synthesis task. Next it uses an enumerative search to systematically ll the draft with expressions and statements from these relevant programs. The resulting program is returned to the programmer, who can modify it and possibly invoke additional rounds of synthesis. We present an implementation of program splicing, called Splicer, for the Java programming language. Splicer uses a corpus of over 3.5 million procedures from an open-source software repository. Our evaluation uses the system in a suite of everyday programming tasks, and includes a comparison with a state-of-the-art competing approach as well as a user study. The results point to the broad scope and scalability of program splicing and indicate that the approach can signi cantly boost programmer productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Splicing', 'Task analysis', 'Databases', 'Synthesizers', 'Programming', 'Java', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['program splicing', 'programming methodology', 'program synthesizer', 'program snippets', 'relevant programs', 'resulting program', 'Java programming language', 'everyday programming tasks'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Big Data', 'Program Synthesis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453092","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Yanxin Lu;Swarat Chaudhuri;Chris Jermaine;David Melski","affiliations":"Rice Univ., Houston, TX, USA;Rice Univ., Houston, TX, USA;Rice Univ., Houston, TX, USA;Grammatech Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative. We changed our focus and performed a thorough investigation of the accuracy of these tools on a variety of SE datasets. Our results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Sentiment analysis', 'Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Task analysis', 'Training', 'Motion pictures'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data analysis', 'data mining', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'sentiment analysis', 'social networking (online)', 'software engineering', 'software libraries'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['sentiment analysis tools', 'app reviews evaluation', 'commit messages', 'out-of-the-box', 'silver bullet', 'crowdsourced opinions mined', 'stack overflow', 'deep learning', 'time-consuming training process', 'effort training process', 'research community', 'developers emotions analyzing', 'software engineering tasks', 'SE datasets', 'software library recommender'], 'Author Keywords ': ['sentiment analysis', 'software engineering', 'NLP']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453067","citationCount":11,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Bin Lin;Fiorella Zampetti;Gabriele Bavota;Massimiliano Di Penta;Michele Lanza;Rocco Oliveto","affiliations":"Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Dept. of Eng., Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Dept. of Eng., Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;STAKE Lab., Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8501934"},{"$numberLong":"8685106"},{"$numberLong":"8725481"},{"$numberLong":"8736222"},{"$numberLong":"8805726"},{"$numberLong":"8816816"},{"$numberLong":"8890439"},{"$numberLong":"8919242"},{"$numberLong":"8945613"},{"$numberLong":"8952437"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453086","title":"To Distribute or Not to Distribute? Why Licensing Bugs Matter","abstract":"Software licenses dictate how source code or binaries can be modified, reused, and redistributed. In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s). Developers and organizations can also modify existing licenses, creating custom licenses with specific permissive/restrictive terms. Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities. Our findings uncover new types of licensing bugs not addressed in prior literature, and a detailed assessment of their implications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses', 'Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Law', 'Guidelines', 'Stakeholders'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software projects', 'software licenses', 'custom licenses', 'software developers', 'license incompatibilities', 'licensing bug developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software Licenses', 'Empirical Studies', 'Open Source Practices']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453086","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Vendome;Daniel German;Massimiliano Di Penta;Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia;Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8930891"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"6945855","title":"The Impact of API Change- and Fault-Proneness on the User Ratings of Android Apps","abstract":"The mobile apps market is one of the fastest growing areas in the information technology. In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

Unfortunately, developing efficient ORM applications is challenging, as the ORM framework hides the underlying database query generation and execution. This problem is becoming more severe as these applications need to process an increasingly large amount of persistent data. Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance anti-patterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them. In this paper, we try to answer these questions through a comprehensive study of 12 representative real-world ORM applications. We generalize 9 ORM performance anti-patterns from more than 200 performance issues that we obtain by studying their bug-tracking systems and profiling their latest versions. To prove our point, we manually fix 64 performance issues in their latest versions and obtain a median speedup of 2 (and up to 39 max) with fewer than 5 lines of code change in most cases. Many of the issues we found have been confirmed by developers, and we have implemented ways to identify other code fragments with similar issues as well.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Rails', 'Scalability', 'Servers', 'Indexes', 'Computer bugs', 'Semantics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'program debugging', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'relational databases'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['persistent data storage', 'efficient ORM applications', 'ORM framework hides', 'underlying database query generation', 'performance problems', 'common performance anti-patterns', 'resulting application performance', 'real-world ORM applications', '200 performance issues', 'performance bugs', 'object relational mapping frameworks', 'database-backed Web applications', 'ORM performance anti-patterns'], 'Author Keywords ': ['performance anti-patterns', 'Object-Relational Mapping frameworks', 'database-backed applications', 'bug study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453153","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Junwen Yang;Cong Yan;Pranav Subramaniam;Shan Lu;Alvin Cheung","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811938"},{"$numberLong":"8952177"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and most recently in the Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work) incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to an app. In this paper [1], we revisit our prior finding in more depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses of 2,328 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1) developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their content, 3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses of the top ten apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue between users and developers provides valuable insights that can lead to improvements in the app store and the user support process. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Our paper is the first work to demonstrate the dynamic nature of reviews. (2) Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate a peculiar use of the app-review platforms as a user support medium. (3) In addition, our work is the first work to deeply explore developer responses in a systematic manner. (4) Finally, our classification of developer-responses highlights the value of providing canned or even automated responses in next generation app-review platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Google', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['consumer behaviour', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['free-to-download apps', 'review-response mechanism', 'mobile app reviews', 'Apple App Store', 'app developers', 'unique user feedback mechanism', 'mobile app stores', 'Google Play Store', 'free apps', 'developer-responses', 'app-review platforms', 'app owners', 'developer responses', 'negative reviews', 'review content', 'review rating', 'review increases', 'developer responding', 'user-developer', 'updated reviews', 'rudimentary user support tool'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Google Play Store', 'User-developer dialogue', 'Developer response', 'Mixed-effect model', 'Android mobile apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453075","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Safwat Hassan;Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

Test minimization aims at removing redundant test cases. However, current techniques remove whole test cases from the test suite using test adequacy criteria, such as code coverage. This has two limitations, namely (1) by removing a whole test case the corresponding test assertions are also lost, which can inhibit test suite effectiveness, (2) the issue of partly redundant test cases, i.e., tests with redundant test statements, is ignored. We propose a novel approach for fine-grained test case minimization. Our analysis is based on the inference of a test suite model that enables automated test reorganization within test cases. It enables removing redundancies at the test statement level, while preserving the coverage and test assertions of the test suite. We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called Testler, on the test suites of 15 open source projects. Our analysis shows that over 4,639 (24%) of the tests in these test suites are partly redundant, with over 11,819 redundant test statements in total. Our results show that Testler removes 43% of the redundant test statements, reducing the number of partly redundant tests by 52%. As a result, test suite execution time is reduced by up to 37% (20% on average), while maintaining the original statement coverage, branch coverage, test assertions, and fault detection capability.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Production', 'Minimization', 'Redundancy', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Software engineering', 'Software systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['test minimization', 'test adequacy criteria', 'corresponding test assertions', 'test suite effectiveness', 'partly redundant test cases', 'fine-grained test case minimization', 'test suite model', 'test reorganization', 'test statement level', 'partly redundant tests', 'test suite execution time', 'redundant test statements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['test minization', 'test reduction', 'test redundancy', 'test model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453080","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Arash Vahabzadeh;Andrea Stocco;Ali Mesbah","affiliations":"Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

One application that is becoming increasingly important is the correction of student submissions in online courses for providing feedback. Most existing program repair techniques analyze Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of programs, which are unfortunately unavailable for programs with syntax errors. In this paper, we propose a novel Neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks with constraint-based reasoning. Specifically, our method first uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform syntax repairs for the buggy programs; subsequently, the resulting syntactically-fixed programs are repaired using constraint-based techniques to ensure functional correctness. The RNNs are trained using a corpus of syntactically correct submissions for a given programming assignment, and are then queried to fix syntax errors in an incorrect programming submission by replacing or inserting the predicted tokens at the error location. We evaluate our technique on a dataset comprising of over 14,500 student submissions with syntax errors. Our method is able to repair syntax errors in 60% (8689) of submissions, and finds functionally correct repairs for 23.8% (3455) submissions.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Syntactics', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Programming', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Prediction algorithms', 'Semantics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer aided instruction', 'educational courses', 'error handling', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'programming', 'recurrent neural nets', 'trees (mathematics)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['program repair techniques', 'neuro-symbolic program corrector', 'introductory programming assignment', 'automatic program correction', 'Abstract Syntax Trees', 'online courses', 'error location', 'syntax errors', 'constraint-based techniques', 'syntactically-fixed programs', 'buggy programs', 'syntax repairs', 'Recurrent Neural Network', 'constraint-based reasoning'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Neural Program Correction', 'Automated Feedback Generation', 'Neural guided search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453063","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sahil Bhatia;Pushmeet Kohli;Rishabh Singh","affiliations":"Netaji Subhas Inst. of Technol., Delhi, India;Google Deepmind, London, UK;Microsoft Res., Redmond, WA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"9015857"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx. We have developed a tool called DYKIS-PD (DYKIS Plagiarism Detection tool) and conducted extensive experiments on large number of binary programs.

Unfortunately, developing efficient ORM applications is challenging, as the ORM framework hides the underlying database query generation and execution. This problem is becoming more severe as these applications need to process an increasingly large amount of persistent data. Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance anti-patterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them. In this paper, we try to answer these questions through a comprehensive study of 12 representative real-world ORM applications. We generalize 9 ORM performance anti-patterns from more than 200 performance issues that we obtain by studying their bug-tracking systems and profiling their latest versions. To prove our point, we manually fix 64 performance issues in their latest versions and obtain a median speedup of 2 (and up to 39 max) with fewer than 5 lines of code change in most cases. Many of the issues we found have been confirmed by developers, and we have implemented ways to identify other code fragments with similar issues as well.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Rails', 'Scalability', 'Servers', 'Indexes', 'Computer bugs', 'Semantics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'program debugging', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'relational databases'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['persistent data storage', 'efficient ORM applications', 'ORM framework hides', 'underlying database query generation', 'performance problems', 'common performance anti-patterns', 'resulting application performance', 'real-world ORM applications', '200 performance issues', 'performance bugs', 'object relational mapping frameworks', 'database-backed Web applications', 'ORM performance anti-patterns'], 'Author Keywords ': ['performance anti-patterns', 'Object-Relational Mapping frameworks', 'database-backed applications', 'bug study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453153","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Junwen Yang;Cong Yan;Pranav Subramaniam;Shan Lu;Alvin Cheung","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811938"},{"$numberLong":"8952177"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, current approaches either do not account for correlations between object fields or do so in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we introduce the problem of composite constant propagation. We develop the first generic solver that infers all possible values of complex objects in an interprocedural, flow and context-sensitive manner, taking field correlations into account. Composite constant propagation problems are specified using COAL, a declarative language. We apply our COAL solver to the problem of inferring Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) values, which is required to understand how the components of Android applications interact. Using COAL, we model ICC objects in Android more thoroughly than the state-of-the-art. We compute ICC values for 460 applications from the Play store. The ICC values we infer are substantially more precise than previous work. The analysis is efficient, taking slightly over two minutes per application on average. While this work can be used as the basis for many whole-program analyses of Android applications, the COAL solver can also be used to infer the values of composite objects in many other contexts.","conference":"IEEE/ACM IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Coal', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Data models', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['mobile computing', 'program diagnostics', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['composite constant propagation', 'Android application', 'intercomponent communication analysis', 'ICC', 'program analysis', 'COAL solver', 'declarative language'], 'Author Keywords ': ['inter-component communication', 'composite constant', 'constant propagation', 'Android', 'Android IPC', 'Android ICC']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194563","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Damien Octeau;Daniel Luchaup;Matthew Dering;Somesh Jha;Patrick McDaniel","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS.

Developers are especially active on these Q\u0026A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q\u0026A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q\u0026A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q\u0026A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q\u0026A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that (i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; (ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; (iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q\u0026A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Knowledge engineering', 'Computer science', 'Logistics', 'Analytical models', 'Mathematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['human factors', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'regression analysis', 'software engineering', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['technical questions', 'incentive systems', 'answer questions', 'rapid answering', 'Q\u0026A website', 'fast answering', 'answerer dimension', 'accepted answer', 'question dimension', 'answer dimension', 'nonfrequent answerers', 'current incentive system motivates frequent answerers', 'answer short questions', 'question answering incentive system', 'stack exchange Websites', 'answer Websites'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Q\u0026A website', 'Factor importance analysis', 'Response time']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453164","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shaowei Wang;Tse-Hsun Chen;Ahmed E.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair.

Such tools are increasingly widely adopted to improve software quality in practice. Automated Program Repair (APR) has the potential to further cut down on the cost of improving software quality. However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in real-world code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Tools', 'Static analysis', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Safety'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal verification', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification', 'software quality', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['bug-finding tools', 'static analysis', 'real-world code', 'undiscovered bugs', 'source-level patches', 'resource leaks', 'general pointer safety properties', 'program fragments', 'semantic effects', 'automated program repair technique', 'verification techniques', 'test suite', 'memory leaks', 'software quality', 'static analysis tools', 'heap properties', 'static automated Program Repair'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Separation Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453073","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rijnard van Tonder;Claire Le Goues","affiliations":";","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8823627"},{"$numberLong":"8823644"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453074","title":"[Journal First] Overfitting in Semantics-Based Automated Program Repair","abstract":"The primary goal of Automated Program Repair (APR) is to automatically fix buggy software, to reduce the manual bug-fix burden that presently rests on human developers. Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Web APIs are rapidly proliferating as a key element to foster reusability, integration, and innovation, enabling new consumption models such as mobile or smart TV apps. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, eBay or Netflix receive billions of API calls every day from thousands of different third-party applications and devices, which constitutes more than half of their total traffic. As Web APIs are progressively becoming the cornerstone of software integration, their validation is getting more critical. In this context, the fast detection of bugs is of utmost importance to increase the quality of internal products and third-party applications. However, testing Web APIs is challenging mainly due to the difficulty to assess whether the output of an API call is correct, i.e., the oracle problem. For instance, consider the Web API of the popular music streaming service Spotify. Suppose a search for albums with the query \"redhouse\" returning 21 total matches: Is this output correct? Do all the albums in the result set contain the keyword? Are there any albums containing the keyword not included in the result set? Answering these questions is difficult, even with small result sets, and often infeasible when the results are counted by thousands or millions. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by providing an alternative when the expected output of a test execution is complex or unknown. Rather than checking the output of an individual program execution, metamorphic testing checks whether multiple executions of the program under test fulfil certain necessary properties called metamorphic relations. For instance, consider the following metamorphic relation in Spotify: two searches for albums with the same query should return the same number of total results regardless of the size of pagination. Suppose that a new Spotify search is performed using the exact same query as before and increasing the maximum number of results per page from 20 (default value) to 50: This search returns 27 total albums (6 more matches than in the previous search), which reveals a bug. This is an example of a real and reproducible fault detected using the approach presented in this paper and reported to Spotify. According to Spotify developers, it was a regression fault caused by a fix with undesired side effects. In this paper [1], we present a metamorphic testing approach for the automated detection of faults in RESTful Web APIs (henceforth also referred to as simply Web APIs). We introduce the concept of metamorphic relation output patterns. A Metamorphic Relation Output Pattern (MROP) defines an abstract output relation typically identified in Web APIs, regardless of their application domain. Each MROP is defined in terms of set operations among test outputs such as equality, union, subset, or intersection. MROPs provide a helpful guide for the identification of metamorphic relations, broadening the scope of our work beyond a particular Web API. Based on the notion of MROP, a methodology is proposed for the application of the approach to any Web API following the REST architectural pattern. The approach was evaluated in several steps. First, we used the proposed methodology to identify 33 metamorphic relations in four Web APIs developed by undergraduate students. All the relations are instances of the proposed MROPs. Then, we assessed the effectiveness of the identified relations at revealing 317 automatically seeded faults (i.e., mutants) in the APIs under test. As a result, 302 seeded faults were detected, achieving a mutation score of 95.3%. Second, we evaluated the approach using real Web APIs and faults. In particular, we identified 20 metamorphic relations in the Web API of Spotify and 40 metamorphic relations in the Web API of YouTube. Each metamorphic relation was implemented and automatically executed using both random and manual test data. In total, 469K metamorphic tests were generated. As a result, 21 metamorphic relations were violated, and 11 issues revealed and reported (3 issues in Spotify and 8 issues in YouTube). To date, 10 of the reported issues have been either confirmed by the API developers or reproduced by other users supporting the effectiveness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Computer bugs', 'YouTube', 'Computer languages', 'Technological innovation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'program testing', 'Web services'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['metamorphic relation output pattern', 'RESTful Web API', 'MROP', 'metamorphic testing', 'REST architectural pattern'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Metamorphic testing', 'REST', 'RESTful Web services', 'Web API']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453162","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sergio Segura;José A.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

In these studies, the main research effort is spent on developing an efficient recombination operator. Such recombination operators use probability distributions around the parent solutions to create an offspring. Some operators emphasize solutions at the center of mass of parents and some around the parents. In this paper, we propose a generic parent-centric recombination operator (PCX) and a steady-state, elite-preserving, scalable, and computationally fast population-alteration model (we call the G3 model). The performance of the G3 model with the PCX operator is investigated on three commonly used test problems and is compared with a number of evolutionary and classical optimization algorithms including other real-parameter GAs with the unimodal normal distribution crossover (UNDX) and the simplex crossover (SPX) operators, the correlated self-adaptive evolution strategy, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), the differential evolution technique, and the quasi-Newton method. The proposed approach is found to consistently and reliably perform better than all other methods used in the study. A scale-up study with problem sizes up to 500 variables shows a polynomial computational complexity of the proposed approach. This extensive study clearly demonstrates the power of the proposed technique in tackling real-parameter optimization problems.","conference":"Evolutionary Computation","terms":"{'Author Keywords ': ['Real-parameter optimization', 'simulated binary crossover', 'self-adaptive evolution strategy', 'covariance matrix adaptation', 'differential evolution', 'quasi-Newton method', 'parent-centric recombination', 'scalable evolutionary algorithms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790885","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2002,"authors":"Kalyanmoy Deb;Ashish Anand;Dhiraj Joshi","affiliations":"Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, PIN 208 016, India deb@iitk.ac.in;Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, PIN 208 016, India ashi@iitk.ac.in;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, 2307 Plaza Drive, State College, PA 16801, USA djoshi@cse.psu.edu","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12bfb04a430c4a6677b0"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8107332"},{"$numberLong":"8027770"},{"$numberLong":"7969361"},{"$numberLong":"7933208"},{"$numberLong":"7850264"},{"$numberLong":"7850218"},{"$numberLong":"7744408"},{"$numberLong":"7744181"},{"$numberLong":"7744179"},{"$numberLong":"7744010"},{"$numberLong":"7727839"},{"$numberLong":"7727320"},{"$numberLong":"7727239"},{"$numberLong":"7551179"},{"$numberLong":"7280535"},{"$numberLong":"7280394"},{"$numberLong":"7257214"},{"$numberLong":"7257249"},{"$numberLong":"7257103"},{"$numberLong":"7256879"},{"$numberLong":"7256880"},{"$numberLong":"7238069"},{"$numberLong":"7055352"},{"$numberLong":"6919306"},{"$numberLong":"6889568"},{"$numberLong":"6889442"},{"$numberLong":"6889421"},{"$numberLong":"6811205"},{"$numberLong":"6807914"},{"$numberLong":"6767195"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"6790764","title":"Combining Convergence and Diversity in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","abstract":"Over the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. Many studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the Pareto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. However, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has a proof of convergence to the true Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. In this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier MOEAs do not have such properties. Based on the concept of -dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to MOEAs that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. A number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. The concept of -dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.","conference":"Evolutionary Computation","terms":"{'Author Keywords ': ['Evolutionary algorithms', 'multiobjective optimization', 'convergence', 'preservation of diversity', '¿-approximation', 'elitism', 'archiving']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790764","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2002,"authors":"Marco Laumanns;Lothar Thiele;Kalyanmoy Deb;Eckart Zitzler","affiliations":"Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland, laumanns@tik.ee.ethz.ch;Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland, thiele@tik.ee.ethz.ch;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, PIN 208 016, India, deb@iitk.ac.in;Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland, zitzler@tik.ee.ethz.ch","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12bfb04a430c4a6677b0"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8031325"},{"$numberLong":"7969638"},{"$numberLong":"7969576"},{"$numberLong":"7969361"},{"$numberLong":"7969343"},{"$numberLong":"7950899"},{"$numberLong":"7928417"},{"$numberLong":"7927160"},{"$numberLong":"7895137"},{"$numberLong":"7886269"},{"$numberLong":"7855746"},{"$numberLong":"7850230"},{"$numberLong":"7850228"},{"$numberLong":"7820199"},{"$numberLong":"7744359"},{"$numberLong":"7744284"},{"$numberLong":"7744255"},{"$numberLong":"7744139"},{"$numberLong":"7744095"},{"$numberLong":"7744096"},{"$numberLong":"7743981"},{"$numberLong":"7551179"},{"$numberLong":"7531874"},{"$numberLong":"7505939"},{"$numberLong":"7469240"},{"$numberLong":"7453157"},{"$numberLong":"7445185"},{"$numberLong":"7386636"},{"$numberLong":"7376743"},{"$numberLong":"7376704"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play.

Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

We introduce a new pointer-analysis-based static analysis, CRed, for finding UAF bugs in multi-MLOC C source code efficiently and effectively. Cred achieves this by making three advances: (i) a spatio-temporal context reduction technique for scaling down soundly and precisely the exponential number of contexts that would otherwise be considered at a pair of free and use sites, (ii) a multi-stage analysis for filtering out false alarms efficiently, and (iii) a path-sensitive demand-driven approach for finding the points-to information required. We have implemented CRed in LLVM-3.8.0 and compared it with four different state-of-the-art static tools: CBMC (model checking), Clang (abstract interpretation), Coccinelle (pattern matching), and Supa (pointer analysis) using all the C test cases in Juliet Test Suite (JTS) and 10 open-source C applications. For the ground-truth validated with JTS, CRed detects all the 138 known UAF bugs as CBMC and Supa do while Clang and Coccinelle miss some bugs, with no false alarms from any tool. For practicality validated with the 10 applications (totaling 3+ MLOC), CRed reports 132 warnings including 85 bugs in 7.6 hours while the existing tools are either unscalable by terminating within 3 days only for one application (CBMC) or impractical by finding virtually no bugs (Clang and Coccinelle) or issuing an excessive number of false alarms (Supa).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Correlation', 'Australia', 'Pattern matching', 'Software', 'Static analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['C language', 'pattern matching', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Coccinelle', 'false alarms', 'pointer-analysis-based static approach', 'zero-day Use-After-Free vulnerabilities', 'pointer-analysis-based static analysis', 'finding UAF bugs', 'multiMLOC C source code', 'spatio-temporal context reduction technique', 'multistage analysis', 'path-sensitive demand-driven approach', 'CBMC', 'Supa', 'Juliet Test Suite', 'open-source C applications', 'UAF bugs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['use after free', 'program analysis', 'bug detection']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453091","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hua Yan;Yulei Sui;Shiping Chen;Jingling Xue","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons-missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data mining', 'Java', 'Software', 'Software reliability', 'Syntactics', 'Libraries'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'Java', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API misuse', 'API usage mining framework', 'potential API usage violations', 'API calls', 'alternative API usage details', 'Stack Overflow posts'], 'Author Keywords ': ['online Q\u0026A forums', 'API usage pattern', 'code example assessment']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453166","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Tianyi Zhang;Ganesha Upadhyaya;Anastasia Reinhardt;Hridesh Rajan;Miryung Kim","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8754426"},{"$numberLong":"8812028"},{"$numberLong":"8812042"},{"$numberLong":"8812114"},{"$numberLong":"8816735"},{"$numberLong":"8816757"},{"$numberLong":"8816758"},{"$numberLong":"8913924"},{"$numberLong":"8952239"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453127","title":"Data Scientists in Software Teams: State of the Art and Challenges","abstract":"The demand for analyzing large scale telemetry, machine, and quality data is rapidly increasing in software industry.

A great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager. Through statistical analysis we identify how engineers and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering differs from other knowledge work groups.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Birds', 'Productivity', 'Organizations', 'Tools', 'Knowledge engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP management', 'project management', 'software development management', 'statistical analysis', 'team working'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['great manager', 'software engineers', 'good team', 'software engineering manager', 'software teams', 'manager attributes', 'software engineering research studies', 'statistical analysis', 'productivity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Manager', 'Software Engineering', 'Knowledge Work', 'Empirical Study', 'Conceptual Framework', 'Manager Attributes', 'Technical Skills']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453140","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Eirini Kalliamvakou;Christian Bird;Thomas Zimmermann;Andrew Begel;Robert DeLine;Daniel M.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons-missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data mining', 'Java', 'Software', 'Software reliability', 'Syntactics', 'Libraries'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'Java', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API misuse', 'API usage mining framework', 'potential API usage violations', 'API calls', 'alternative API usage details', 'Stack Overflow posts'], 'Author Keywords ': ['online Q\u0026A forums', 'API usage pattern', 'code example assessment']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453166","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Tianyi Zhang;Ganesha Upadhyaya;Anastasia Reinhardt;Hridesh Rajan;Miryung Kim","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8754426"},{"$numberLong":"8812028"},{"$numberLong":"8812042"},{"$numberLong":"8812114"},{"$numberLong":"8816735"},{"$numberLong":"8816757"},{"$numberLong":"8816758"},{"$numberLong":"8913924"},{"$numberLong":"8952239"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453131","title":"Collective Program Analysis","abstract":"Popularity of data-driven software engineering has led to an increasing demand on the infrastructures to support efficient execution of tasks that require deeper source code analysis. While task optimization and parallelization are the adopted solutions, other research directions are less explored. We present collective program analysis (CPA), a technique for scaling large scale source code analyses, especially those that make use of control and data flow analysis, by leveraging analysis specific similarity. Analysis specific similarity is about, whether two or more programs can be considered similar for a given analysis. The key idea of collective program analysis is to cluster programs based on analysis specific similarity, such that running the analysis on one candidate in each cluster is sufficient to produce the result for others. For determining analysis specific similarity and clustering analysis-equivalent programs, we use a sparse representation and a canonical labeling scheme. Our evaluation shows that for a variety of source code analyses on a large dataset of programs, substantial reduction in the analysis time can be achieved; on average a 69% reduction when compared to a baseline and on average a 36% reduction when compared to a prior technique. We also found that a large amount of analysis-equivalent programs exists in large datasets.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Transfer functions', 'Cloning', 'Software engineering', 'Task analysis', 'Syntactics', 'Analytical models', 'Labeling'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data flow analysis', 'pattern clustering', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collective program analysis', 'cluster programs', 'data-driven software engineering', 'deeper source code analysis', 'scale source code analyses', 'data flow analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Source code analysis', 'Clustering', 'Boa']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453131","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Ganesha Upadhyaya;Hridesh Rajan","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Unfortunately, developing efficient ORM applications is challenging, as the ORM framework hides the underlying database query generation and execution. This problem is becoming more severe as these applications need to process an increasingly large amount of persistent data. Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance anti-patterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them. In this paper, we try to answer these questions through a comprehensive study of 12 representative real-world ORM applications. We generalize 9 ORM performance anti-patterns from more than 200 performance issues that we obtain by studying their bug-tracking systems and profiling their latest versions. To prove our point, we manually fix 64 performance issues in their latest versions and obtain a median speedup of 2 (and up to 39 max) with fewer than 5 lines of code change in most cases. Many of the issues we found have been confirmed by developers, and we have implemented ways to identify other code fragments with similar issues as well.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Rails', 'Scalability', 'Servers', 'Indexes', 'Computer bugs', 'Semantics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'program debugging', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'relational databases'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['persistent data storage', 'efficient ORM applications', 'ORM framework hides', 'underlying database query generation', 'performance problems', 'common performance anti-patterns', 'resulting application performance', 'real-world ORM applications', '200 performance issues', 'performance bugs', 'object relational mapping frameworks', 'database-backed Web applications', 'ORM performance anti-patterns'], 'Author Keywords ': ['performance anti-patterns', 'Object-Relational Mapping frameworks', 'database-backed applications', 'bug study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453153","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Junwen Yang;Cong Yan;Pranav Subramaniam;Shan Lu;Alvin Cheung","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811938"},{"$numberLong":"8952177"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

As the Linux kernel forms the central part of various operating systems that are used by millions of users, the kernel must be continuously adapted to the changing demands and expectations of these users. The Linux kernel provides its services to an application through system calls. The combined set of all system calls forms the essential Application Programming Interface (API) through which an application interacts with the kernel. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 8,770 changes that were made to Linux system calls during the last decade (i.e., from April 2005 to December 2014). In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls). In addition, we find that by far, the ptraceand signal handling system calls are the most challenging to maintain.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We extensively compare MAHAKIL with five other sampling approaches using 20 releases of defect datasets from the PROMISE repository and five prediction models.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Servers', 'Security', 'Databases', 'Static analysis', 'Feature extraction'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile-app behaviors', 'EnMobile', 'benign apps', 'entity-based characterization', 'modern mobile malware', 'mobile platform', 'modern mobile apps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Analysis', 'Mobile Security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453096","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wei Yang;Mukul Prasad;Tao Xie","affiliations":";Fujitsu Labs. of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816783"},{"$numberLong":"8913874"},{"$numberLong":"8952382"},{"$numberLong":"8952509"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

App reviews provide an opportunity to proactively collect user complaints and promptly improve apps' user experience, in terms of bug fixing and feature refinement. However, the tremendous quantities of reviews and noise words (e.g., misspelled words) increase the difficulties in accurately identifying newly-appearing app issues. In this paper, we propose a novel and automated framework IDEA, which aims to IDentify Emerging App issues effectively based on online review analysis. We evaluate IDEA on six popular apps from Google Play and Apple's App Store, employing the official app changelogs as our ground truth. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of IDEA in identifying emerging app issues. Feedback from engineers and product managers shows that 88.9% of them think that the identified issues can facilitate app development in practice. Moreover, we have successfully applied IDEA to several products of Tencent, which serve hundreds of millions of users.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Meteorology', 'Facebook', 'Google', 'Semantics', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['noise words', 'emerging app issues', 'IDEA', 'popular apps', 'official app changelogs', 'app development', 'online App review analysis', 'App reviews', 'Apple App Store'], 'Author Keywords ': ['app reviews', 'online analysis', 'emerging issues']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453061","citationCount":7,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Cuiyun Gao;Jichuan Zeng;Michael R.

It is useful to indicate when a bug report will be closed, since it would help software teams to prioritise their work. Several studies have been conducted to address this problem in the past decade. Most of these studies have used the frequency of occurrence of certain developer activities as input attributes in building their prediction models. However, these approaches tend to ignore the temporal nature of the occurrence of these activities. In this paper, a novel approach using Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and temporal sequences of developer activities is proposed. The approach is empirically demonstrated in a case study using eight years of bug reports collected from the Firefox project.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Hidden Markov models', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data science', 'Predictive models', 'Industrial engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['hidden Markov models', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software developers', 'bug report', 'software teams', 'prediction models', 'hidden Markov model', 'bug fixing', 'Firefox project', 'HMM'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Bug repositories', 'Temporal activities', 'Time to fix a bug', 'Hidden Markov model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453139","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mayy Habayeb;Syed Shariyar Murtaza;Andriy Miranskyy;Ayse Basar Bener","affiliations":"Dept. of Mech. \u0026 Ind.

We introduce a new pointer-analysis-based static analysis, CRed, for finding UAF bugs in multi-MLOC C source code efficiently and effectively. Cred achieves this by making three advances: (i) a spatio-temporal context reduction technique for scaling down soundly and precisely the exponential number of contexts that would otherwise be considered at a pair of free and use sites, (ii) a multi-stage analysis for filtering out false alarms efficiently, and (iii) a path-sensitive demand-driven approach for finding the points-to information required. We have implemented CRed in LLVM-3.8.0 and compared it with four different state-of-the-art static tools: CBMC (model checking), Clang (abstract interpretation), Coccinelle (pattern matching), and Supa (pointer analysis) using all the C test cases in Juliet Test Suite (JTS) and 10 open-source C applications. For the ground-truth validated with JTS, CRed detects all the 138 known UAF bugs as CBMC and Supa do while Clang and Coccinelle miss some bugs, with no false alarms from any tool. For practicality validated with the 10 applications (totaling 3+ MLOC), CRed reports 132 warnings including 85 bugs in 7.6 hours while the existing tools are either unscalable by terminating within 3 days only for one application (CBMC) or impractical by finding virtually no bugs (Clang and Coccinelle) or issuing an excessive number of false alarms (Supa).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Correlation', 'Australia', 'Pattern matching', 'Software', 'Static analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['C language', 'pattern matching', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Coccinelle', 'false alarms', 'pointer-analysis-based static approach', 'zero-day Use-After-Free vulnerabilities', 'pointer-analysis-based static analysis', 'finding UAF bugs', 'multiMLOC C source code', 'spatio-temporal context reduction technique', 'multistage analysis', 'path-sensitive demand-driven approach', 'CBMC', 'Supa', 'Juliet Test Suite', 'open-source C applications', 'UAF bugs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['use after free', 'program analysis', 'bug detection']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453091","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hua Yan;Yulei Sui;Shiping Chen;Jingling Xue","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Then later in the development cycle, these architectural choices must be implemented completely and correctly so there will not be any drift from envisioned design. In this paper, we use data analytics-based techniques to study five large-scale software systems, examining the impact and the role of software architects who write code on software quality. Our quantitative study is augmented with a follow-up interview of architects. This paper provides empirical evidence for supporting the pragmatic opinions that architects should write code. Our analysis shows that implementing architectural tactics is more complex than delivering functionality, tactics are more error prone than software functionalities, and the architects tend to introduce fewer bugs into the implementation of architectural tactics compared to the developers.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data analysis', 'software architecture', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['architectural choices', 'large-scale software systems', 'software architects', 'software quality', 'quantitative study', 'architectural tactics', 'software functionalities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Architect', 'coding', 'tactics', 'architecture savvy']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453069","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Inayat Rehman;Mehdi Mirakhorli;Meiyappan Nagappan;Azat Aralbay Uulu;Matthew Thornton","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Studies indicate that sentiment analysis tools provide unreliable results when used out-of-the-box, since they are not designed to process SE datasets. The silver bullet for a successful application of sentiment analysis tools to SE datasets might be their customization to the specific usage context. We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting crowdsourced opinions mined from Stack Overflow (e.g., what is the sentiment of developers about the usability of a library). To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative.

Following this initial mock-up, the design artifacts are then handed off to developers whose goal is to accurately implement these GUIs and the desired functionality in code. Given the sizable abstraction gap between mock-ups and code, developers often introduce mistakes related to the GUI that can negatively impact an app's success in highly competitive marketplaces. Moreover, such mistakes are common in the evolutionary context of rapidly changing apps. This leads to the time-consuming and laborious task of design teams verifying that each screen of an app was implemented according to intended design specifications. This paper introduces a novel, automated approach for verifying whether the GUI of a mobile app was implemented according to its intended design. Our approach resolves GUI-related information from both implemented apps and mock-ups and uses computer vision techniques to identify common errors in the implementations of mobile GUIs. We implemented this approach for Android in a tool called GVT and carried out both a controlled empirical evaluation with open-source apps as well as an industrial evaluation with designers and developers from Huawei. The results show that GVT solves an important, difficult, and highly practical problem with remarkable efficiency and accuracy and is both useful and scalable from the point of view of industrial designers and developers. The tool is currently used by over one-thousand industrial designers and developers at Huawei to improve the quality of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Tools', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Visualization', 'Layout', 'Computer vision'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['graphical user interfaces', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['GUI design violations', 'mobile app', 'design artifacts', 'mock-ups', 'intended design specifications', 'open-source apps', 'mobile GUI'], 'Author Keywords ': ['GUI', 'design', 'Mobile Apps', 'Android', 'Computer Vision']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453076","citationCount":6,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kevin Moran;Boyang Li;Carlos Bernal-Cárdenas;Dan Jelf;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It aims to predict defect-prone software modules before defects are discovered, therefore it can be used to better prioritise software quality assurance effort. In recent years, especially for recent 3 years, many new defect prediction studies have been proposed. The goal of this study is to comprehensively review, analyse and discuss the state-of-the-art of defect prediction. The authors survey almost 70 representative defect prediction papers in recent years (January 2014-April 2017), most of which are published in the prominent software engineering journals and top conferences. The selected defect prediction papers are summarised to four aspects: machine learning-based prediction algorithms, manipulating the data, effort-aware prediction and empirical studies. The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building methods and many research opportunities exist. The identified challenges can give some practical guidelines for both software engineering researchers and practitioners in future software defect prediction.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['quality assurance', 'research and development', 'software quality', 'software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software defect prediction', 'software engineering journals', 'defect-prone software modules', 'software quality assurance', 'machine learning-based prediction algorithms', 'data manipulation', 'effort-aware prediction', 'empirical studies']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371784","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":39,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhiqiang Li;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Xiaoke Zhu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8689135"},{"$numberLong":"8719520"},{"$numberLong":"8747001"},{"$numberLong":"8758097"},{"$numberLong":"8946058"},{"$numberLong":"8978786"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"4027145"},{"$numberLong":"5611551"},{"$numberLong":"4408585"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"1702388"},{"$numberLong":"295895"},{"$numberLong":"5070510"},{"$numberLong":"7447797"},{"$numberLong":"5328803"},{"$numberLong":"6624058"},{"$numberLong":"6698911"},{"$numberLong":"6676898"},{"$numberLong":"5306304"},{"$numberLong":"6341763"},{"$numberLong":"7180126"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"},{"$numberLong":"4527256"},{"$numberLong":"4288197"},{"$numberLong":"6419712"},{"$numberLong":"6509481"},{"$numberLong":"7497471"},{"$numberLong":"7435328"},{"$numberLong":"6226427"},{"$numberLong":"7476658"},{"$numberLong":"6363444"},{"$numberLong":"4288196"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"7780202"},{"$numberLong":"6803085"},{"$numberLong":"6227194"},{"$numberLong":"5609530"},{"$numberLong":"6954519"},{"$numberLong":"4623684"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"7182807"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

While there have been many tools to mitigate UAF vulnerabilities, UAF remains one of the most common attack vectors. UAF is particularly di cult to detect in concurrent programs, in which a UAF may only occur with rare thread schedules. In this paper, we present a novel technique, UFO, that can precisely predict UAFs based on a single observed execution trace with a provably higher detection capability than existing techniques with no false positives. The key technical advancement of UFO is an extended maximal thread causality model that captures the largest possible set of feasible traces that can be inferred from a given multithreaded execution trace. By formulating UAF detection as a constraint solving problem atop this model, we can explore a much larger thread scheduling space than classical happens-before based techniques. We have evaluated UFO on several real-world large complex C/C++ programs including Chromium and FireFox. UFO scales to real-world systems with hundreds of millions of events in their execution and has detected a large number of real concurrency UAFs.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Instruction sets', 'Concurrent computing', 'Schedules', 'Browsers', 'Tools', 'Chromium', 'Encoding'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['multi-threading', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'scheduling', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['program operating', 'critical software systems', 'UAF vulnerabilities', 'common attack vectors', 'concurrent programs', 'rare thread schedules', 'single observed execution trace', 'provably higher detection capability', 'extended maximal thread causality model', 'UAF detection', 'larger thread scheduling space', 'UFO scales', 'concurrency use-after-free detection', 'use-after-free vulnerabilities', 'multithreaded execution trace', 'concurrency UAF'], 'Author Keywords ': ['UAF', 'Concurrency', 'Vulnerabilities', 'UFO']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453130","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jeff Huang","affiliations":"Parasol Lab., Texas A\u0026M Univ., College Station, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8754099"},{"$numberLong":"8952233"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

While CI environments provide advantages, they also utilize non-trivial amounts of time and resources. To address this issue, researchers have adapted techniques for test case prioritization (TCP) to CI environments. To date, however, the techniques considered have operated on test suites, and have not achieved substantial improvements. Moreover, they can be inappropriate to apply when system build costs are high. In this work we explore an alternative: prioritization of commits. We use a lightweight approach based on test suite failure and execution history that is highly efficient; our approach \"continuously\" prioritizes commits that are waiting for execution in response to the arrival of each new commit and the completion of each previously scheduled commit. We have evaluated our approach on three non-trivial CI data sets.

The uniqueness of this protocol is that it considers a systematic exploration of the perturbation space as well as perfect oracles to determine the correctness of the output.

Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling--dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['project management', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['implicit dependencies', 'task links', 'extent change propagation', 'underlying task dependency', 'linked task pairs', 'nonlinked task pairs', 'software development efforts', 'explicit handling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['task links', 'change propagation', 'bugzilla', 'mylyn', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453099","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christoph Mayr-Dorn;Alexander Egyed","affiliations":"Johannes Kepler Univ., Linz, Austria;Johannes Kepler Univ., Linz, Austria","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8667990"},{"$numberLong":"8816766"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

What would it take to change your mind? That's essentially the dilemma faced by advocates of test-driven development (TDD). The TDD paradigm argues that the basic cycle of developing code and then testing it to make sure it does what it's supposed to do-something drilled into most of us from the time we began learning software development- isn't the most effective approach. TDD replaces the traditional \"code then test\" cycle. First, you develop test cases for a small increment of functionality; then you write code that makes those tests run correctly. After each increment, you refactor the code to maintain code quality.","conference":"IEEE Software","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'software maintenance', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['test driven development', 'code development', 'software development', 'code refactoring', 'code quality'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software engineering']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5604358","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":1,"year":2010,"authors":"Forrest Shull;Grigori Melnik;Burak Turhan;Lucas Layman;Madeline Diep;Hakan Erdogmus","affiliations":"University of Maryland;Microsoft;University of Oulu;University of Maryland;University of Nebraska-Lincoln;Kalemun Research","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c1b04a430c4a667800"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"6005486"},{"$numberLong":"6612871"},{"$numberLong":"6298092"},{"$numberLong":"7360030"},{"$numberLong":"7833380"},{"$numberLong":"6681343"},{"$numberLong":"7005209"},{"$numberLong":"7427895"},{"$numberLong":"7194615"},{"$numberLong":"6111358"},{"$numberLong":"6336718"},{"$numberLong":"5707981"},{"$numberLong":"7934714"},{"$numberLong":"6197200"},{"$numberLong":"8405634"},{"$numberLong":"8719427"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"4163024"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Developers are especially active on these Q\u0026A websites, since developers are constantly facing new development challenges that require help from other experts. Over the years, Q\u0026A website designers have derived several incentive systems (e.g., gamification) to encourage users to answer questions that are posted by others. However, the current incentive systems primarily focus on the quantity and quality of the answers instead of encouraging the rapid answering of questions. Improving the speed of getting an answer can significantly improve the user experience and increase user engagement on such Q\u0026A websites. In this paper [1], we study the factors for fast answers on such Q\u0026A websites. Our goal is to explore how one may improve the current incentive systems to motivate fast answering of questions. We use a logistic regression model to analyze 46 factors along four dimensions (i.e., question, asker, answer, and answerer dimension) in order to understand the relationship between the studied factors and the needed time to get an accepted answer. The question dimension calculates various textual and readability features of a question, as well as the popularity and difficulty of the question's tags. The asker dimension calculates the reputation of an asker and his/her historical tendency to get answers. The answer dimension computes textual features from the text of the accepted answer. The answerer dimension computes the historical activity level of the answerer who answered the question. We conduct our study on the four most popular (i.e., with the most questions) Q\u0026A Stack Exchange websites: Stack Overflow, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu, and Superuser. We find that (i) factors in the answerer dimension have the strongest effect on the needed time to get an accepted answer, after controlling for other factors; (ii) the current incentive system does not recognize non-frequent answerers who often answer questions which frequent answerers are not able to answer well. Such questions that are answered by non-frequent answerers are as important as those that are answered by frequent answerers; (iii) the current incentive system motivates frequent answerers well, but such frequent answerers tend to answer short questions. Our findings suggest that the designers of Q\u0026A website should improve their incentive systems to motivate non-frequent answerers to be more active and to answer questions faster, in order to shorten the waiting time for an answer (especially for questions that require specific knowledge that frequent answerers might not possess). In addition, the question answering incentive system needs to factor in the value and difficulty of answering the questions (e.g., by providing more rewards to harder questions or questions that remain unanswered for a long period of time).","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Knowledge engineering', 'Computer science', 'Logistics', 'Analytical models', 'Mathematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['human factors', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'regression analysis', 'software engineering', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['technical questions', 'incentive systems', 'answer questions', 'rapid answering', 'Q\u0026A website', 'fast answering', 'answerer dimension', 'accepted answer', 'question dimension', 'answer dimension', 'nonfrequent answerers', 'current incentive system motivates frequent answerers', 'answer short questions', 'question answering incentive system', 'stack exchange Websites', 'answer Websites'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Q\u0026A website', 'Factor importance analysis', 'Response time']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453164","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shaowei Wang;Tse-Hsun Chen;Ahmed E.

JIT models are trained using techniques that assume that past fix-inducing changes are similar to future ones. However, this assumption may not hold, e.g., as system complexity tends to accrue, expertise may become more important as systems age. In this paper, we study JIT models as systems evolve. Through a longitudinal case study of 37,524 changes from the rapidly evolving Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that fluctuations in the properties of fix-inducing changes can impact the performance and interpretation of JIT models. More specifically: (a) the discriminatory power (AUC) and calibration (Brier) scores of JIT models drop considerably one year after being trained; (b) the role that code change properties (e.g., Size, Experience) play within JIT models fluctuates over time; and (c) those fluctuations yield over- and underestimates of the future impact of code change properties on the likelihood of inducing fixes. To avoid erroneous or misleading predictions, JIT models should be retrained using recently recorded data (within three months). Moreover, quality improvement plans should be informed by JIT models that are trained using six months (or more) of historical data, since they are more resilient to period-specific fluctuations in the importance of code change properties.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Predictive models', 'History', 'Fluctuations', 'Training', 'Data models', 'Software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'just-in-time', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'public domain software', 'software fault tolerance', 'software management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['fix-inducing changes', 'JIT models', 'just-in-time models', 'just-in-time defect prediction', 'Qt systems', 'OpenStack systems', 'fix-inducing code changes', 'code change properties'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Just In Time prediction', 'Defect prediction', 'Mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453123","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shane McIntosh;Yasutaka Kamei","affiliations":"McGill Univ., Montréal, QC, Canada;Kyushu Univ., Fukuoka, Japan","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816772"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Change impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that identifies impact sets, i.e., the set of classes that require correction as a result of a change made to a class or artefact. These sets can also be considered as ripple effects and typically non-local: changes propagate to different parts of a system. Two classes are considered logically coupled if they have co-changed in the past; past research has shown that the precision of CIA techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling (i.e., the extent to which the lexical content of two classes is related) are both considered. However, the relationship between semantic and logical coupling of software artefacts has not been extensively studied and no dependencies established between these two types of coupling. Are two often co-changed artefacts also strongly connected from a semantic point of view? Are two semantically similar artefacts bound to co-change in the future? Answering those questions would help increase the precision of CIA. It would also help software maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to co-evolve in the future. This study investigated the relationship between semantic and logical coupling. Using Chi-squared statistical tests, we identified similarities in semantic coupling using class corpora and class identifiers. We then computed Spearman's rank correlation between semantic and logical coupling metrics for class pairs to detect whether semantic and logical relationships co-varied in OO software. Finally, we investigated the overlap between semantic and logical relationships by identifying the proportion of classes linked through both coupling types. Our empirical study and results were based on seventy-nine open-source software projects. Results showed that: (a) measuring the semantic similarity of classes by using their identifiers is computationally efficient; (b) using identifier-based coupling can be used interchangeably with semantic similarity based on their corpora, albeit not always; (c) no correlation between the strengths of semantic and change coupling was found. Finally, (d) a directional relationship between the two was identified; 70% of semantic dependencies are linked through change coupling but not vice versa. Based on our findings, we conclude that identifying more efficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a directional relationship between semantic and change dependencies could help to improve CIA methods that integrate semantic coupling information. This may also help to reveal implicit dependencies not captured by static source code analysis.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Semantics', 'Couplings', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Measurement', 'Software engineering', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['object-oriented programming', 'software maintenance', 'software metrics', 'software quality', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['directional relationship', 'semantic dependencies', 'semantic coupling computation', 'semantic coupling information', 'software classes', 'software systems', 'software quality', 'change impact analysis', 'CIA', 'software artefacts', 'semantically similar artefacts', 'software maintainers', 'class corpora', 'class identifiers', 'semantic coupling metrics', 'logical coupling metrics', 'semantic relationships', 'logical relationships', 'OO software', 'coupling types', 'open-source software projects', 'semantic similarity', 'identifier-based coupling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Semantic coupling', 'co-change', 'Java software', 'metrics']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453103","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Nemitari Ajienka;Andrea Capiluppi;Steve Counsell","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative.

However, misusing them can cost developers time and effort, as well as introduce security vulnerabilities in software. We conducted an empirical study on StackOverflow posts, aiming to understand developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and insecure coding practices. We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and documentation, as well as the huge gap between security theory and coding practices.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Java', 'Cryptography', 'Encoding', 'Libraries', 'Programming', 'Authentication'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'authorisation', 'computer crime', 'cryptography', 'Java', 'XML'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['secure coding practices', 'Java platform', 'third-party libraries', 'developers time', 'empirical study', 'StackOverflow posts', 'Java secure coding', 'programming obstacles', 'insecure coding practices', 'authorization features', 'third-party framework', 'programming challenges', 'complicated cross-language data handling', 'complex Java-based', 'XML-based approaches', 'cross-site request forgery attacks', 'Spring security', 'cryptography API', 'SSL-TLS security', 'secure coding assistance', 'StackOverflow forum', 'multiple security vulnerabilities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Secure coding', 'Spring security', 'CSRF', 'SSL/TLS', 'certificate validation', 'cryptographic hash functions', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'StackOverflow', 'cryptography']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453095","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Na Meng;Stefan Nagy;Danfeng Yao;Wenjie Zhuang;Gustavo Arango-Argoty","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

However, some fundamental questions, such as how new fixes overlap with old fixes, have not been investigated. Intuitively, the overlap between old and new fixes decides how APR approaches can construct new fixes with old ones. Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes. Our results show that if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the content of past fixes, only 2.1% and 3.2% new fixes can be created from single or multiple past fixes in the same project, compared with 0.9% and 1.2% fixes created from past fixes across projects. However, if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the code structure of past fixes, up to 41.3% and 29.7% new fixes can be created.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Syntactics', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['automatic program repair', 'APR approach', 'delta dependency graphs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['reusing past fix', 'empirical study', 'program repair']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453165","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hao Zhong;Na Meng","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Given a background in software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and tools from academia did I use in my daily work when developing and testing the systems of these companies? Regarding validation and verification (my main area of research), the answer is rather short: as far as I can tell, only FindBugs. In this paper, I report on why this was the case, and discuss all the challenging, complex open problems we face in industry and which somehow are \"neglected\" in the academic circles. In particular, I will first discuss what actual tools I could use in my daily work, such as JaCoCo and Selenium. Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly related to environment simulators, unit and web testing. After that, popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I worked on in industry is then discussed.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance. We then evaluate each approach in 2,135 queries extracted from three open source software and one industrial software system. Our results show that GA is able to completely cover 98.6% of all queries in the dataset, requiring only a few seconds per query. Moreover, it does not suffer from the limitations affecting state-of-the art techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Databases', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Search problems', 'Structured Query Language', 'Toy manufacturing industry', 'Software systems', 'Engines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['database management systems', 'genetic algorithms', 'program testing', 'query processing', 'search problems', 'SQL'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['SQL query', 'complex queries', 'model test data generation', 'physical query plan', 'Search-Based Test Data Generation', 'database-centric systems', 'SQL queries', 'SQL commands', 'constraint satisfaction problem', 'search-based problem', 'biased random search', 'genetic algorithms', 'database engine', 'search guidance', 'open source software', 'industrial software system'], 'Author Keywords ': ['search based software engineering', 'automated test data generation', 'SQL', 'databases']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453204","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jeroen Castelein;Maurício Aniche;Mozhan Soltani;Annibale Panichella;Arie van Deursen","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8812175"},{"$numberLong":"8919030"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However, the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherently nonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria. In this paper, we propose a framework that formulates the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we programmatically transform this nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly available dataset and minimization problems involving multiple criteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability, and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the optimal solutions outperform the suboptimal ones by up to 164.29% in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Minimization', 'Linear programming', 'Optimization', 'Mathematical model', 'Tools', 'Testing', 'Programming'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['integer programming', 'linear programming', 'minimisation', 'nonlinear programming', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['redundant test cases', 'optimal solution', 'multicriteria test-suite minimization problem', 'test-case criteria', 'integer nonlinear programming problem'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test-suite minimization', 'integer programming']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453182","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jun-Wei Lin;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Joshua Garcia;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8753481"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453114","title":"[Journal First] Lightweight, Obfuscation-Resilient Detection and Family Identification of Android Malware","abstract":"The number of malicious Android apps has been and continues to increase rapidly.

To address these challenges, we present a novel machine learning-based Android malware detection and family-identification approach, RevealDroid, that operates without the need to perform complex program analyses or extract large sets of features. RevealDroid's selected features leverage categorized Android API usage, reflection-based features, and features from native binaries of apps. We assess RevealDroid for accuracy, efficiency, and obfuscation resilience using a large dataset consisting of more than 54,000 malicious and benign apps. Our experiments show that RevealDroid achieves an accuracy of 98% in detection of malware and an accuracy of 95% in determination of their families.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven's default flaky test detector.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Monitoring', 'Testing', 'Java', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Syntactics', 'Detectors'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing', 'public domain software', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DeFlaker', 'test failure', 'unknown flaky tests'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'flaky tests', 'code coverage']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453104","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jonathan Bell;Owolabi Legunsen;Michael Hilton;Lamyaa Eloussi;Tifany Yung;Darko Marinov","affiliations":"George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719555"},{"$numberLong":"8730188"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8821891"},{"$numberLong":"8952328"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]},{"_id":"8453146","title":"[Journal First] The Scent of a Smell: An Extensive Comparison Between Textual and Structural Smells","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design or implementation choices that have a negative effect on several aspects of software maintenance and evolution, such as program comprehension or change-and fault-proneness. This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

However, the code snippets in such a forum often contain undeclared, ambiguous, or largely unqualified external references. Such declaration ambiguity and external reference ambiguity present challenges for developers in learning to correctly use the APIs. In this paper, we propose StatType, a statistical approach to resolve the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the API elements in such code snippets. Unlike existing approaches that are based on heuristics, StatType has two well-integrated factors. We first learn from a large training code corpus the FQNs that often co-occur. Then, to derive the FQN for an API name in a code snippet, we use that knowledge and leverage the context consisting of neighboring API names. To realize those factors, we treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that StatType achieves very high accuracy with 97.6% precision and 96.7% recall, which is 16.5% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computational modeling', 'Software libraries', 'Training', 'Software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Internet', 'language translation', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'software libraries', 'statistical analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['machine translation', 'StackOverflow posts', 'API fully qualified names', 'statistical learning', 'partially qualified names', 'source code', 'API name', 'training code corpus', 'API elements', 'FQNs', 'statistical approach', 'StatType', 'external reference', 'declaration ambiguity', 'code snippet', 'software libraries', 'online forums', 'software developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Type Resolution', 'Type Inference', 'Type Annotations', 'Partial Program Analysis', 'Statistical Machine Translation', 'Naturalness', 'Big Code']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453132","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hung Phan;Hoan Anh Nguyen;Ngoc M.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Most research and applications of such approach focus on N-way combinatorial testing that provides a minimum coverage of all N-way interactions among factor. However, the strengths of different interactions may not be a fixed integer N, but a variable. Therefore, variable strength combinatorial testing approach is necessary in applications. Existing variable strength combinatorial testing, which allows some interactions have a higher strength than others, has a limitation that such higher-strength interactions must be disjoint. To avoid such a limitation, an improved variable strength combinatorial testing approach, which makes a more sufficient consideration on actual interaction relationship, is proposed in this article.

Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven's default flaky test detector.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Monitoring', 'Testing', 'Java', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Syntactics', 'Detectors'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing', 'public domain software', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DeFlaker', 'test failure', 'unknown flaky tests'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'flaky tests', 'code coverage']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453104","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jonathan Bell;Owolabi Legunsen;Michael Hilton;Lamyaa Eloussi;Tifany Yung;Darko Marinov","affiliations":"George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719555"},{"$numberLong":"8730188"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8821891"},{"$numberLong":"8952328"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic. Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE. Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques. Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Analytical models', 'Unified modeling language', 'Stakeholders', 'Collaborative software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'groupware', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collaborative model-driven software engineering', 'CoSE', 'UML-based approach', 'decision making', 'understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches', 'model-driven engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Collaborative MDSE', 'CoMDSE', 'C MDSE', 'model driven engineering', 'collaborative software engineering', 'CoSE', 'systematic mapping study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453119","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Davide Di Ruscio;Mirco Franzago;Ivano Malavolta;Henry Muccini","affiliations":"DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;Vrije Univ.

Display represents a significant portion of an app's energy consumption. However, developers lack techniques to identify the user interfaces in their apps for which energy needs to be improved. In this paper, we present a technique for detecting display energy hotspots - user interfaces of a mobile app whose energy consumption is greater than optimal. Our technique leverages display power modeling and automated display transformation techniques to detect these hotspots and prioritize them for developers. In an evaluation on a set of popular Android apps, our technique was very accurate in both predicting energy consumption and ranking the display energy hotspots. Our approach was also able to detect display energy hotspots in 398 Android market apps, showing its effectiveness and the pervasiveness of the problem. These results indicate that our approach represents a potentially useful technique for helping developers to detect energy related problems and reduce the energy consumption of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Color', 'Energy consumption', 'User interfaces', 'Power demand', 'Mobile communication', 'Smart phones', 'Monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'power aware computing', 'user interfaces'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['display energy hotspots detection', 'user interfaces', 'mobile app', 'energy consumption', 'display power modeling', 'automated display transformation techniques', 'Android market apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102585","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":6,"year":2015,"authors":"Mian Wan;Yuchen Jin;Ding Li;William G.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be generated, without blocking any correct patches.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Search problems', 'Software', 'Computer crashes', 'Null value', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['automatic programming', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying patch correctness', 'test-based program repair', 'automatic program repair', 'incorrect patches', 'generated patches', 'behavior similarity', 'test case executions', 'passing tests', 'original programs', 'patched programs', 'similar runtime behavior', 'correct patches', 'program repair systems', 'jGenProg'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test based program repair', 'patch correctness', 'patch classification', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453152","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Yingfei Xiong;Xinyuan Liu;Muhan Zeng;Lu Zhang;Gang Huang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8812054"},{"$numberLong":"8805696"},{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8918958"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However, the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherently nonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria. In this paper, we propose a framework that formulates the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we programmatically transform this nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly available dataset and minimization problems involving multiple criteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability, and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the optimal solutions outperform the suboptimal ones by up to 164.29% in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Minimization', 'Linear programming', 'Optimization', 'Mathematical model', 'Tools', 'Testing', 'Programming'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['integer programming', 'linear programming', 'minimisation', 'nonlinear programming', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['redundant test cases', 'optimal solution', 'multicriteria test-suite minimization problem', 'test-case criteria', 'integer nonlinear programming problem'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test-suite minimization', 'integer programming']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453182","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jun-Wei Lin;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Joshua Garcia;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8753481"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

To this end, many guidelines have been proposed to contribute to the execution and repeatability of literature reviews, and to the confidence of their results, especially regarding systematic literature reviews (SLR). To investigate similarities and differences, and to characterize the challenges and pitfalls of the planning and generated results of SLR research protocols dealing with the same research question and performed by similar teams of novice researchers in the context of the software engineering field. We qualitatively compared (using Jaccard and Kappa coefficients) and evaluated (using DARE) same goal SLR research protocols and outcomes undertaken by similar research teams. Seven similar SLR protocols regarding quality attributes for use cases executed in 2010 and 2012 enabled us to observe unexpected differences in their planning and execution. Even when the participants reached some agreement in the planning, the outcomes were different. The research protocols and reports allowed us to observe six challenges contributing to the divergences in the results: researchers' inexperience in the topic, researchers' inexperience in the method, lack of clearness and completeness of the papers, lack of a common terminology regarding the problem domain, lack of research verification procedures, and lack of commitment to the SLR. According to our findings, it is not possible to rely on results of SLRs performed by novices. Also, similarities at a starting or intermediate step during different SLR executions may not directly translate to the next steps, since non-explicit information might entail differences in the outcomes, hampering the repeatability and confidence of the SLR process and results. Although we do have expectations that the presence and follow-up of a senior researcher can contribute to increasing SLRs' repeatability, this conclusion can only be drawn upon the existence of additional studies on this topic. Yet, systematic planning, transparency of decisions and verification procedures are key factors to guarantee the reliability of SLRs.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Software', 'Planning', 'Protocols', 'Knowledge engineering', 'Systematics', 'Terminology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'project management', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unexpected differences', 'research verification procedures', 'similar SLR protocols', 'software engineering field', 'SLR research protocols', 'systematic literature reviews', 'software industry', 'software technologies', 'evidence-based software engineering approach', 'software engineering technical literature', 'systematic planning', 'additional studies', 'senior researcher', 'SLR process'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Novice researchers', 'Systematic literature review', 'Evidence based software engineering', 'Exploratory study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453200","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Talita Vieira Ribeiro;Jobson Massollar;Guilherme Horta Travassos","affiliations":"PESC/COPPE, Fed.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Firstly, there are potentially two different standardized mean difference effect sizes that can be calculated, depending on whether the mean difference is standardized by the pooled within groups variance or the within-participants variance. Hence, we provided equations for non-standardized and standardized effect sizes and explained the need for two different types of standardized effect size, one for the repeated measures and one that would be equivalent to an independent groups design. Secondly, as for any estimated parameters and also for the purposes of undertaking meta-analysis, it is necessary to calculate the variance of the standardized mean difference effect sizes (which is not the same as the variance of the study). Hence, we provided formulas for the small sample size effect size variance and the medium sample size approximation to the effect size variance, for both types of standardized effect size. We also presented the model underlying the AB/BA crossover design and provided two examples (an empirical analysis of the real data set by Scanniello, as well as simulated data) to demonstrate how to construct the two standardized mean difference effect sizes and their variances, both from standard descriptive statistics and from the outputs provided by the linear mixed model package lme4 in R. A conclusion is that crossover designs should be considered (instead of between groups design) only if:  previous research has suggested that  is greater than zero and preferably greater than 0.25;  there is either strong theoretical argument, or empirical evidence from a well-powered study, that the period by technique interaction is negligible. Summarizing, our journal first paper [3]: (1) Presents the formulas needed to calculate both non-standardized and standardized mean difference effect sizes for AB/BA crossover designs (see Section 4 and 5 of our paper [3]). (2) Presents the formulas needed to estimate the variances of the non-standardized and standardized effect sizes which in the later cases need to be appropriate for the small to medium sample sizes commonly used in software engineering crossover designs (see Section 5 of our paper [3]). (3) Explains how to calculate the effect sizes and their variances both from the descriptive statistics that should be reported and from the raw data (see Section 6 of our paper [3]). It is worth mentioning that we based our formulas on our own corrections to the formulas presented earlier by Curtin et al. [1]. Our corrections for the variances of standardized weighted mean difference of an AB/BA cross-over trial were accepted by the author of the original formulas (Curtin), submitted jointly as a letter to Editor of Statistics in Medicine to assure the widespread (also beyond the software engineering domain) adoption of the corrected formulas, and accepted [2]. We proposed an alternative formulation of the standardized effect size for individual difference effects that is comparable with the standardized effect size commonly used for pretest/posttest studies. We also corrected the small sample size and moderate sample size variances reported by Curtin et al. for both the individual difference effect size and the standardized effect size comparable to independent groups trials, showing the derivation of the formulas from the variance of at-variable. Using these results, researchers can now correctly calculate standardized effect size variances, allowing the calculation of confidence intervals for AB/BA cross-over trials, which in turn provides a direct link to null hypothesis testing and supports meta-analysis. Meta-analysts can now validly aggregate together results from independent groups, pretest/posttest and AB/BA cross-over trials. Last but not least, the presented contributions allow corrections of previously reported results.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Size measurement', 'Analytical models', 'Data models', 'Standards', 'Clinical trials', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['medical computing', 'software engineering', 'statistical analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['standardized mean difference effect sizes', 'standardized weighted mean difference', 'sample size effect size variance', 'medium sample size approximation', 'difference effect size', 'AB-BA crossover design', 'software engineering literature', 'meta-analysis', 'standard descriptive statistics', 'linear mixed model package', 'null hypothesis testing', 'posttest studies', 'pretest studies', 'software engineering crossover designs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical software engineering', 'Meta-analysis', 'Effect size']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453101","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lech Madeyski;Barbara Kitchenham","affiliations":"Fac. of Comput.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Change impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that identifies impact sets, i.e., the set of classes that require correction as a result of a change made to a class or artefact. These sets can also be considered as ripple effects and typically non-local: changes propagate to different parts of a system. Two classes are considered logically coupled if they have co-changed in the past; past research has shown that the precision of CIA techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling (i.e., the extent to which the lexical content of two classes is related) are both considered. However, the relationship between semantic and logical coupling of software artefacts has not been extensively studied and no dependencies established between these two types of coupling. Are two often co-changed artefacts also strongly connected from a semantic point of view? Are two semantically similar artefacts bound to co-change in the future? Answering those questions would help increase the precision of CIA. It would also help software maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to co-evolve in the future. This study investigated the relationship between semantic and logical coupling. Using Chi-squared statistical tests, we identified similarities in semantic coupling using class corpora and class identifiers. We then computed Spearman's rank correlation between semantic and logical coupling metrics for class pairs to detect whether semantic and logical relationships co-varied in OO software. Finally, we investigated the overlap between semantic and logical relationships by identifying the proportion of classes linked through both coupling types. Our empirical study and results were based on seventy-nine open-source software projects. Results showed that: (a) measuring the semantic similarity of classes by using their identifiers is computationally efficient; (b) using identifier-based coupling can be used interchangeably with semantic similarity based on their corpora, albeit not always; (c) no correlation between the strengths of semantic and change coupling was found. Finally, (d) a directional relationship between the two was identified; 70% of semantic dependencies are linked through change coupling but not vice versa. Based on our findings, we conclude that identifying more efficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a directional relationship between semantic and change dependencies could help to improve CIA methods that integrate semantic coupling information. This may also help to reveal implicit dependencies not captured by static source code analysis.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Semantics', 'Couplings', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Measurement', 'Software engineering', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['object-oriented programming', 'software maintenance', 'software metrics', 'software quality', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['directional relationship', 'semantic dependencies', 'semantic coupling computation', 'semantic coupling information', 'software classes', 'software systems', 'software quality', 'change impact analysis', 'CIA', 'software artefacts', 'semantically similar artefacts', 'software maintainers', 'class corpora', 'class identifiers', 'semantic coupling metrics', 'logical coupling metrics', 'semantic relationships', 'logical relationships', 'OO software', 'coupling types', 'open-source software projects', 'semantic similarity', 'identifier-based coupling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Semantic coupling', 'co-change', 'Java software', 'metrics']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453103","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Nemitari Ajienka;Andrea Capiluppi;Steve Counsell","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

A Large Scale Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults","abstract":"Empirical validation of software testing studies is increasingly relying on mutants. This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and De-fects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also found that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we found that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Fault detection', 'Correlation', 'Java', 'Measurement', 'Software testing', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mutation score', 'randomly selected test suites', 'higher mutation scores', 'mutation scores correlated', 'real fault detection', 'scale empirical study', 'empirical validation', 'software testing studies', 'mutant scores', 'test suite size', 'dependent variable the detection', 'fault detection capability'], 'Author Keywords ': ['mutation testing', 'real faults', 'test suite effectiveness']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mike Papadakis;Donghwan Shin;Shin Yoo;Doo-Hwan Bae","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730152"},{"$numberLong":"8735019"},{"$numberLong":"8919245"},{"$numberLong":"8952421"},{"$numberLong":"8705674"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453106","title":"Time to Clean Your Test Objectives","abstract":"Testing is the primary approach for detecting software defects. A major challenge faced by testers lies in crafting efficient test suites, able to detect a maximum number of bugs with manageable effort. To do so, they rely on coverage criteria, which define some precise test objectives to be covered. However, many common criteria specify a significant number of objectives that occur to be infeasible or redundant in practice, like covering dead code or semantically equal mutants. Such objectives are well-known to be harmful to the design of test suites, impacting both the efficiency and precision of the tester's effort. This work introduces a sound and scalable technique to prune out a significant part of the infeasible and redundant objectives produced by a panel of white-box criteria. In a nutshell, we reduce this task to proving the validity of logical assertions in the code under test. The technique is implemented in a tool that relies on weakest-precondition calculus and SMT solving for proving the assertions. The tool is built on top of the Frama-C verification platform, which we carefully tune for our specific scalability needs. The experiments reveal that the pruning capabilities of the tool can reduce the number of targeted test objectives in a program by up to 27% and scale to real programs of 200K lines, making it possible to automate a painstaking part of their current testing process.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software safety', 'Security', 'Software testing', 'Scalability'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['significant number', 'dead code', 'semantically equal mutants', 'scalable technique', 'infeasible objectives', 'redundant objectives', 'white-box criteria', 'logical assertions', 'targeted test objectives', 'current testing process', 'primary approach', 'detecting software defects', 'efficient test suites', 'coverage criteria', 'precise test objectives'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Coverage Criteria', 'Infeasible Objectives', 'Redundant Objectives']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453106","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Michaël Marcozzi;Sébastien Bardin;Nikolai Kosmatov;Mike Papadakis;Virgile Prevosto;Loïc Correnson","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput., Imperial Coll.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx. We have developed a tool called DYKIS-PD (DYKIS Plagiarism Detection tool) and conducted extensive experiments on large number of binary programs. The tool, the benchmarks and the experimental results are all publicly available.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Plagiarism', 'Licenses', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Watermarking'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['fraud', 'program diagnostics', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DYKIS plagiarism detection tool', 'DYKIS-PD', 'Upx', 'Allatori', 'SandMark', 'compiler optimization', 'code obfuscation', 'source code', 'software birthmark', 'dynamic key instruction sequences', 'software plagiarism detection'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software plagiarism detection', 'software birthmark']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7153572","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":10,"year":2015,"authors":"Zhenzhou Tian;Qinghua Zheng;Ting Liu;Ming Fan;Eryue Zhuang;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7496465"},{"$numberLong":"8080048"},{"$numberLong":"7774504"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"7490384"},{"$numberLong":"8293854"},{"$numberLong":"7883388"},{"$numberLong":"7888597"},{"$numberLong":"8629870"},{"$numberLong":"8812083"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1219058"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"6328271"},{"$numberLong":"6086533"},{"$numberLong":"1610609"},{"$numberLong":"1019480"},{"$numberLong":"514697"},{"$numberLong":"4023995"},{"$numberLong":"957835"},{"$numberLong":"1698785"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic. Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE. Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques. Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Analytical models', 'Unified modeling language', 'Stakeholders', 'Collaborative software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'groupware', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collaborative model-driven software engineering', 'CoSE', 'UML-based approach', 'decision making', 'understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches', 'model-driven engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Collaborative MDSE', 'CoMDSE', 'C MDSE', 'model driven engineering', 'collaborative software engineering', 'CoSE', 'systematic mapping study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453119","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Davide Di Ruscio;Mirco Franzago;Ivano Malavolta;Henry Muccini","affiliations":"DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;Vrije Univ.

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling--dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['project management', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['implicit dependencies', 'task links', 'extent change propagation', 'underlying task dependency', 'linked task pairs', 'nonlinked task pairs', 'software development efforts', 'explicit handling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['task links', 'change propagation', 'bugzilla', 'mylyn', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453099","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christoph Mayr-Dorn;Alexander Egyed","affiliations":"Johannes Kepler Univ., Linz, Austria;Johannes Kepler Univ., Linz, Austria","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8667990"},{"$numberLong":"8816766"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

The crosscutting nature of these development tasks requires developers to maintain complex mental models and forces them (a) to manually split their high-level tasks into low-level commands that are supported by the various tools, and (b) to (re) establish their current context in each tool. In this paper we present Devy, a Conversational Developer Assistant (CDA) that enables developers to focus on their high-level development tasks. Devy reduces the number of manual, often complex, low-level commands that developers need to perform, freeing them to focus on their high-level tasks. Specifically, Devy infers high-level intent from developer's voice commands and combines this with an automatically-generated context model to determine appropriate workflows for invoking low-level tool actions; where needed, Devy can also prompt the developer for additional information. Through a mixed methods evaluation with 21 industrial developers, we found that Devy provided an intuitive interface that was able to support many development tasks while helping developers stay focused within their development environment. While industrial developers were largely supportive of the automation Devy enabled, they also provided insights into several other tasks and workflows CDAs could support to enable them to better focus on the important parts of their development tasks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Task analysis', 'Tools', 'Context', 'Context modeling', 'Software', 'Switches'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['interactive systems', 'software engineering', 'ubiquitous computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['high-level tasks', 'low-level commands', 'Devy', 'high-level development tasks', 'high-level intent', 'automatically-generated context model', 'low-level tool actions', 'development environment', 'context-aware conversational developer assistants', 'modern software systems'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Conversational Development Assistants', 'Natural User Interfaces']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453178","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Nick Bradley;Thomas Fritz;Reid Holmes","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

However, current approaches either do not account for correlations between object fields or do so in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we introduce the problem of composite constant propagation. We develop the first generic solver that infers all possible values of complex objects in an interprocedural, flow and context-sensitive manner, taking field correlations into account. Composite constant propagation problems are specified using COAL, a declarative language. We apply our COAL solver to the problem of inferring Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) values, which is required to understand how the components of Android applications interact. Using COAL, we model ICC objects in Android more thoroughly than the state-of-the-art. We compute ICC values for 460 applications from the Play store. The ICC values we infer are substantially more precise than previous work. The analysis is efficient, taking slightly over two minutes per application on average. While this work can be used as the basis for many whole-program analyses of Android applications, the COAL solver can also be used to infer the values of composite objects in many other contexts.","conference":"IEEE/ACM IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Coal', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Data models', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['mobile computing', 'program diagnostics', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['composite constant propagation', 'Android application', 'intercomponent communication analysis', 'ICC', 'program analysis', 'COAL solver', 'declarative language'], 'Author Keywords ': ['inter-component communication', 'composite constant', 'constant propagation', 'Android', 'Android IPC', 'Android ICC']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194563","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Damien Octeau;Daniel Luchaup;Matthew Dering;Somesh Jha;Patrick McDaniel","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Moreover, the nature of issues with the same severity, e.g., high, differs markedly between desktops and smartphones. To understand these differences, we perform an empirical study on 72 Android and desktop projects. We first define three bug severity classes: high, medium, and low. Next, we study how severity changes and quantify differences between classes in terms of bug-fixing attributes. Then, we focus on topic differences: using LDA, we extract topics associated with each severity class, and study how these topics differ across classes, platforms, and over time. Our findings include: severity and priority affect bug fixing time; medium-severity contributors are more experienced than high-severity contributors; and there have been more concurrency and cloud-related high-severity bugs on desktop since 2009, while on Android concurrency bugs are prevalent.","conference":"IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Concurrent computing', 'Feature extraction', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'concurrency (computers)', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android projects', 'desktop projects', 'bug severity classes:', 'bug-fixing attributes', 'topic differences:', 'LDA', 'severity class', 'bug fixing time', 'medium-severity contributors', 'high-severity contributors', 'cloud-related high-severity bugs', 'Android concurrency bugs', 'bug characteristics', 'Latent Dirichlet allocation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Bug severity', 'cross-platform analysis', 'bug report', 'topic model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7381843","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Bo Zhou;Iulian Neamtiu;Rajiv Gupta","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b3b04a430c4a6675f8"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811953"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This study has applications in source code generation, code completion, and software forensics and investigation. The study also benefits software developers and programmers striving to improve code efficiency and speed up development process. With source code analysis, the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) which is very useful in NLP, becomes severely limited by its inability to handle the semantic and syntactic properties of source codes. Therefore, we processed the source code datasets as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) rather than the source code text itself to take advantage of the information-rich structure of the AST. The proposed model is built on the deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures.

In this paper, we propose a novel static CDA technique that is multi-granular in the sense that it can detect all conflicts and dependencies on multiple granularity levels. Specifically, we provide an efficient algorithm suite for computing binary, coarse-grained, and fine-grained conflicts and dependencies: Binary granularity indicates the presence or absence of conflicts and dependencies, coarse granularity focuses on root causes for conflicts and dependencies, and fine granularity shows each conflict and dependency in full detail. Doing so, we can address specific performance and usability requirements that we identified in a literature survey of CDA usage scenarios. In an experimental evaluation, our algorithm suite computes conflicts and dependencies rapidly. Finally, we present a user study, in which the participants found our coarse-grained results more understandable than the fine-grained ones reported in a state-of-the-art tool.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

Such decisions are taken with varying degrees of expertise in security. In some organisations - particularly those with resources - these are the preserve of computer (or information) security teams. In others - typically smaller organisations - the computing services team may be charged with the responsibility. Often managers have a role to play as guardians of business targets and goals. Be it common workplace practices or strategic decision making, security decisions underpin not only the initial security requirements and their prioritisation but also the adaptation and evolution of these requirements as new business or security contexts arise. However, little is currently understood about how these various demographics approach cyber security decisions and the strategies and approaches that underpin those decisions. What are the typical decision patterns, if any, the consequences of such patterns and their impact (positive or negative) on the security of the system in question? Nor is there any substantial understanding of how the strategies and decision patterns of these different groups contrast. Is security expertise necessarily an advantage when making security decisions in a given context? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the \"how\" and \"why\" behind security decision processes. The Game: In this talk [1], we present a tabletop game - Decisions and Disruptions (D-D) [2] - as a means to investigate these very questions. The game tasks a group of players with managing the security of a small utility company while facing a variety of threats. The game provides a requirements sandbox in which players can experiment with threats, learn about decision making and its consequences, and reflect on their own perception of risk. The game is intentionally kept short - 2 hours - and simple enough to be played without prior training. A cyber-physical infrastructure, depicted through a Lego(R) board, makes the game easy to understand and accessible to players from varying backgrounds and security expertise, without being too trivial a setting for security experts. Key insights: We played D-D with 43 players divided into homogeneous groups (group sizes of 2-6 players): 4 groups of security experts, 4 groups of non-technical managers and 4 groups of general computer scientists. Such observations should, of course, not be generalised, however, the substantial sample size enables in-depth qualitative analysis. Our analysis reveals a number of novel insights regarding security decisions of our three demographics: - Strategies: Security experts had a strong interest in advanced technological solutions and tended to neglect intelligence gathering, to their own detriment: some security expert teams achieved poor results in the game. Managers, too, were technology-driven and focused on data protection while neglecting human factors more than other groups. Computer scientists tended to balance human factors and intelligence gathering with technical solutions, and achieved the best results of the three demographics. - Decision Processes: Technical experience significantly changes the way players think. Teams with little technical experience had shallow, intuition-driven discussions with few concrete arguments. Technical teams, and the most experienced in particular, had much richer debates, driven by concrete scenarios, anecdotes from experience, and procedural thinking. Security experts showed a high confidence in their decisions - despite some of them having bad consequences - while the other groups tended to doubt their own skills - even when they were playing good games. - Patterns: A number of characteristic plays could be identified, some good (balance between priorities, open-mindedness, and adapting strategies based on inputs that challenge one's pre-conceptions), some bad (excessive focus on particular issues, confidence in charismatic leaders), some ugly (\"tunnel vision\" syndrome by over-confident players). These patterns are documented and discussed in the full paper - showing the virtue of the positive ones, discouraging the negative ones, and inviting the readers to do their own introspection. Conclusion: D-D complements existing work on gamification as a means to improve security awareness, education, and training. Beyond the analysis of the security decisions of the three demographics, there is a definite educational and awareness-raising aspect to D-D (as noted consistently by players in all our subject groups). Game boxes will be brought to the conference for demonstration purposes, and the audience will be invited to experiment with D-D themselves, make their own decisions, and reflect on their own perception of security.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Games', 'Cyber-physical systems', 'Computer security', 'Software engineering', 'Privacy', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer games', 'cyber-physical systems', 'decision making', 'game theory', 'human factors', 'organisational aspects', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'tabletop game', 'stakeholders decisions', 'organisations', 'computer security teams', 'demographics approach', 'decisions and disruptions', 'D-D', 'sandbox requirements', 'qualitative analysis', 'human factors', 'gamification', 'security expert teams', 'players', 'cyber security decisions', 'cyber-physical systems game'], 'Author Keywords ': ['security decisions', 'security requirements', 'game', 'decision patterns']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453113","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sylvain Frey;Awais Rashid;Pauline Anthonysamy;Maria Pinto-Albuquerque;Syad Asad Naqvi","affiliations":"Univ. of Southampton, Southampton, UK;Univ. of Bristol, Bristol, UK;Google, Switzerland;Inst.

Program reduction is important and widely demanded for testing and debugging. For example, all compiler/interpreter development projects need effective program reduction to minimize failure-inducing test programs to ease debugging. However, state-of-the-art program reduction techniques - notably Delta Debugging (DD), Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD), and C-Reduce - do not perform well in terms of speed (reduction time) and quality (size of reduced programs), or are highly customized for certain languages and thus lack generality. This paper presents Perses, a novel framework for effective, efficient, and general program reduction. The key insight is to exploit, in a general manner, the formal syntax of the programs under reduction and ensure that each reduction step considers only smaller, syntactically valid variants to avoid futile efforts on syntactically invalid variants. Our framework supports not only deletion (as for DD and HDD), but also general, effective program transformations. We have designed and implemented Perses, and evaluated it for two language settings: C and Java. Our evaluation results on 20 C programs triggering bugs in GCC and Clang demonstrate Perses's strong practicality compared to the state-of-the-art: (1) smaller size - Perses's results are respectively 2% and 45% in size of those from DD and HDD; and (2) shorter reduction time - Perses takes 23% and 47% time taken by DD and HDD respectively. Even when compared to the highly customized and optimized C-Reduce for C/C++, Perses takes only 38-60% reduction time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Grammar', 'Debugging', 'Syntactics', 'Computer bugs', 'Program processors', 'Sun', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DD', 'HDD', 'shorter reduction time - Perses', 'syntax-guided program reduction', 'C program', 'effective program reduction', 'failure-inducing test programs', 'reduced programs', 'general program reduction', 'reduction step', 'general program transformations', 'effective program transformations', 'compiler-interpreter development projects', 'program reduction techniques', 'hierarchical Delta debugging', 'efficient program reduction'], 'Author Keywords ': ['program reduction', 'delta debugging', 'debugging']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453094","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chengnian Sun;Yuanbo Li;Qirun Zhang;Tianxiao Gu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA;Univ. of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8952444"},{"$numberLong":"8952321"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8371742","title":"How test suites impact fault localisation starting from the size","abstract":"Although a test suite is indispensable for conducting effective fault localisation, not much work has been done to study how the test suite impacts fault localisation.

Moreover, the nature of issues with the same severity, e.g., high, differs markedly between desktops and smartphones. To understand these differences, we perform an empirical study on 72 Android and desktop projects. We first define three bug severity classes: high, medium, and low. Next, we study how severity changes and quantify differences between classes in terms of bug-fixing attributes. Then, we focus on topic differences: using LDA, we extract topics associated with each severity class, and study how these topics differ across classes, platforms, and over time. Our findings include: severity and priority affect bug fixing time; medium-severity contributors are more experienced than high-severity contributors; and there have been more concurrency and cloud-related high-severity bugs on desktop since 2009, while on Android concurrency bugs are prevalent.","conference":"IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Concurrent computing', 'Feature extraction', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'concurrency (computers)', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android projects', 'desktop projects', 'bug severity classes:', 'bug-fixing attributes', 'topic differences:', 'LDA', 'severity class', 'bug fixing time', 'medium-severity contributors', 'high-severity contributors', 'cloud-related high-severity bugs', 'Android concurrency bugs', 'bug characteristics', 'Latent Dirichlet allocation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Bug severity', 'cross-platform analysis', 'bug report', 'topic model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7381843","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Bo Zhou;Iulian Neamtiu;Rajiv Gupta","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b3b04a430c4a6675f8"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811953"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Thus, it is significant to check whether certificate validation in SSL/TLS is correctly implemented. With this motivation, we propose a novel differential testing approach which is directed by the standard Request For Comments (RFC). First, rules of certificates are extracted automatically from RFCs. Second, low-level test cases are generated through dynamic symbolic execution. Third, high-level test cases, i.e. certificates, are assembled automatically. Finally, with the assembled certificates being test cases, certificate validations in SSL/TLS implementations are tested to reveal latent vulnerabilities or bugs. Our approach named RFCcert has the following advantages: (1) certificates of RFCcert are discrepancy-targeted since they are assembled according to standards instead of genetics; (2) with the obtained certificates, RFCcert not only reveals the invalidity of traditional differential testing but also is able to conduct testing that traditional differential testing cannot do; and (3) the supporting tool of RFCcert has been implemented and extensive experiments show that the approach is effective in finding bugs of SSL/TLS implementations.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Computer bugs', 'Public key', 'Standards', 'Servers', 'Protocols'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['certification', 'computer network security', 'Internet', 'program testing', 'protocols', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['RFC-directed differential testing', 'certificate validation', 'Internet security', 'novel differential testing approach', 'low-level test cases', 'high-level test cases', 'assembled certificates', 'RFCcert', 'traditional differential testing', 'secure socket layer', 'transport layer security protocol', 'SSL-TLS implementations'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Differential testing', 'certificate validation', 'SSL/TLS', 'dynamic symbolic execution', 'Request For Comments']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453160","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chu Chen;Cong Tian;Zhenhua Duan;Liang Zhao","affiliations":"ICTT \u0026 ISN Lab., Xidian Univ.

As the Linux kernel forms the central part of various operating systems that are used by millions of users, the kernel must be continuously adapted to the changing demands and expectations of these users. The Linux kernel provides its services to an application through system calls. The combined set of all system calls forms the essential Application Programming Interface (API) through which an application interacts with the kernel. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 8,770 changes that were made to Linux system calls during the last decade (i.e., from April 2005 to December 2014). In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls). In addition, we find that by far, the ptraceand signal handling system calls are the most challenging to maintain. Our study can be used by developers who want to improve the design and ensure the successful evolution of their own kernel APIs.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Linux', 'Kernel', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Linux', 'operating system kernels', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['essential application programming interface', 'kernel API', 'sibling calls', 'operating systems', 'Linux kernel forms', 'Linux system calls'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Linux kernel', 'System calls', 'API evolution', 'Software evolution']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453085","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mojtaba Bagherzadeh;Nafiseh Kahani;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

In turn, consumers can influence the software development process by giving developers early feedback. This early access model has become increasingly popular through digital distribution platforms, such as Steam which is the most popular distribution platform for games. The plethora of options offered by Steam to communicate between developers and game players contribute to the popularity of the early access model. The early access model made a name for itself through several successful games, such as the DayZ game. The multiplayer survival-based game reached 400,000 sales during its first week as an early access game. However, the benefits of the early access model have been questioned as well. For instance, the Spacebase DF-9 game abandoned the early access stage unexpectedly, disappointing many players of the game. Shortly after abandoning the early access stage and terminating the development, twelve employees were laid off including the programmer and project lead. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 1,182 Early Access Games (EAGs) on the Steam platform to understand the characteristics, advantages and limitations of the early access model. We find that 15% of the games on Steam make use of the early access model, with the most popular EAG having as many as 29 million owners. 88% of the EAGs are classified by their developers as so-called \"indie\" games, indicating that most EAGs are developed by individual developers or small studios. We study the interaction between players and developers of EAGs and the Steam platform. We observe that on the one hand, developers update their games more frequently in the early access stage. On the other hand, the percentage of players that review a game during its early access stage is lower than the percentage of players that review the game after it leaves the early access stage. However, the average rating of the reviews is much higher during the early access stage, suggesting that players are more tolerant of imperfections in the early access stage. The positive review rate does not correlate with the length or the game update frequency of the early access stage. In addition, we discuss several learned lessons from the failure of an early access game. The main learned lesson from this failure is that the communication between the game developer and the players of the EAG is crucial. Players enjoy getting involved in the development of an early access game and they get emotionally involved in the decision-making about the game. Based on our findings, we suggest game developers to use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, our findings suggest that developers can determine their release schedule without worrying about the length of the early access stage and the game update frequency during the early access stage.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Games', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Decision making', 'Schedules', 'Lead', 'Computational modeling'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer games', 'sales management', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['game developer', 'game players', 'Steam platform', 'software development process', 'consumers', 'digital distribution platforms', 'DayZ game', 'multiplayer survival-based game', 'Spacebase DF-9 game', 'employees', 'programmer', 'project lead', 'decision-making', 'EAG', 'early access stage', 'early access game', 'early access model'], 'Author Keywords ': ['early access games', 'computer games', 'Steam']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453108","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Dayi Lin;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and most recently in the Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work) incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to an app. In this paper [1], we revisit our prior finding in more depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses of 2,328 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1) developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their content, 3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses of the top ten apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue between users and developers provides valuable insights that can lead to improvements in the app store and the user support process. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Our paper is the first work to demonstrate the dynamic nature of reviews. (2) Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate a peculiar use of the app-review platforms as a user support medium. (3) In addition, our work is the first work to deeply explore developer responses in a systematic manner. (4) Finally, our classification of developer-responses highlights the value of providing canned or even automated responses in next generation app-review platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Google', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['consumer behaviour', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['free-to-download apps', 'review-response mechanism', 'mobile app reviews', 'Apple App Store', 'app developers', 'unique user feedback mechanism', 'mobile app stores', 'Google Play Store', 'free apps', 'developer-responses', 'app-review platforms', 'app owners', 'developer responses', 'negative reviews', 'review content', 'review rating', 'review increases', 'developer responding', 'user-developer', 'updated reviews', 'rudimentary user support tool'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Google Play Store', 'User-developer dialogue', 'Developer response', 'Mixed-effect model', 'Android mobile apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453075","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Safwat Hassan;Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn;Cor-Paul Bezemer;Ahmed E.

Abstract test cases (ATCs) are derived from models of the system under test and have been applied to many testing environments such as model-based testing and combinatorial interaction testing. Although various empirical and analytical comparisons for some ATC prioritisation (ATCP) techniques have been conducted, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no comparative study focusing on the most current techniques has yet been reported. In this study, they investigated 18 ATCP techniques, categorised into four classes. They conducted a comprehensive empirical study to compare 16 of the 18 ATCP techniques in terms of their testing effectiveness and efficiency.

However, misusing them can cost developers time and effort, as well as introduce security vulnerabilities in software. We conducted an empirical study on StackOverflow posts, aiming to understand developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and insecure coding practices. We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and documentation, as well as the huge gap between security theory and coding practices.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Java', 'Cryptography', 'Encoding', 'Libraries', 'Programming', 'Authentication'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'authorisation', 'computer crime', 'cryptography', 'Java', 'XML'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['secure coding practices', 'Java platform', 'third-party libraries', 'developers time', 'empirical study', 'StackOverflow posts', 'Java secure coding', 'programming obstacles', 'insecure coding practices', 'authorization features', 'third-party framework', 'programming challenges', 'complicated cross-language data handling', 'complex Java-based', 'XML-based approaches', 'cross-site request forgery attacks', 'Spring security', 'cryptography API', 'SSL-TLS security', 'secure coding assistance', 'StackOverflow forum', 'multiple security vulnerabilities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Secure coding', 'Spring security', 'CSRF', 'SSL/TLS', 'certificate validation', 'cryptographic hash functions', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'StackOverflow', 'cryptography']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453095","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Na Meng;Stefan Nagy;Danfeng Yao;Wenjie Zhuang;Gustavo Arango-Argoty","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

However, some fundamental questions, such as how new fixes overlap with old fixes, have not been investigated. Intuitively, the overlap between old and new fixes decides how APR approaches can construct new fixes with old ones. Based on this intuition, we systematically designed six overlap metrics, and performed an empirical study on 5,735 bug fixes to investigate the usefulness of past fixes when composing new fixes. For each bug fix, we created delta dependency graphs (i.e., program dependency graphs for code changes), and identified how bug fixes overlapped with each other in terms of the content, code structure, and identifier names of fixes. Our results show that if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the content of past fixes, only 2.1% and 3.2% new fixes can be created from single or multiple past fixes in the same project, compared with 0.9% and 1.2% fixes created from past fixes across projects. However, if an APR approach composes new fixes by fully or partially reusing the code structure of past fixes, up to 41.3% and 29.7% new fixes can be created.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Syntactics', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['automatic program repair', 'APR approach', 'delta dependency graphs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['reusing past fix', 'empirical study', 'program repair']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453165","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hao Zhong;Na Meng","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Test minimization aims at removing redundant test cases. However, current techniques remove whole test cases from the test suite using test adequacy criteria, such as code coverage. This has two limitations, namely (1) by removing a whole test case the corresponding test assertions are also lost, which can inhibit test suite effectiveness, (2) the issue of partly redundant test cases, i.e., tests with redundant test statements, is ignored. We propose a novel approach for fine-grained test case minimization. Our analysis is based on the inference of a test suite model that enables automated test reorganization within test cases. It enables removing redundancies at the test statement level, while preserving the coverage and test assertions of the test suite. We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called Testler, on the test suites of 15 open source projects. Our analysis shows that over 4,639 (24%) of the tests in these test suites are partly redundant, with over 11,819 redundant test statements in total. Our results show that Testler removes 43% of the redundant test statements, reducing the number of partly redundant tests by 52%. As a result, test suite execution time is reduced by up to 37% (20% on average), while maintaining the original statement coverage, branch coverage, test assertions, and fault detection capability.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Production', 'Minimization', 'Redundancy', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Software engineering', 'Software systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['test minimization', 'test adequacy criteria', 'corresponding test assertions', 'test suite effectiveness', 'partly redundant test cases', 'fine-grained test case minimization', 'test suite model', 'test reorganization', 'test statement level', 'partly redundant tests', 'test suite execution time', 'redundant test statements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['test minization', 'test reduction', 'test redundancy', 'test model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453080","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Arash Vahabzadeh;Andrea Stocco;Ali Mesbah","affiliations":"Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We extensively compare MAHAKIL with five other sampling approaches using 20 releases of defect datasets from the PROMISE repository and five prediction models.

In this process, reviews from users provide valuable information for developers to analyse the model with users sentiments. In this study, the authors combine the goal model with reviews for supporting the evolution of Apps. First, the authors introduce the reviews into the goal model as a new factor by comparing keywords. Second, the users sentiments in reviews are mined, and two kinds of information are gained by analysing the model to help developers make decisions on which goals to be improved in next version: one kind of information is about users sentiments on the goals to evaluate whether users like them; another kind is the impact of updating one goal to others. To validate the proposed approach, they conducted experiments and a survey based on the Apps in Google Play. The results show that the proposed approach can establish relationships between goals and reviews reasonably and further provide useful information for optimising the evolution strategy of the App.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'evolutionary computation', 'iterative methods', 'sentiment analysis', 'social networking (online)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'evolution strategy', 'Google Play', 'valuable information', 'updating strategy', 'Apps', 'iterative development process', 'goal model', 'user sentiments']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986852","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":14,"year":2020,"authors":"Yuzhou Liu;Lei Liu;Huaxiao Liu;Shanquan Gao","affiliations":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, People's Republic of China;College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, People's Republic of China;College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, People's Republic of China;College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12ccb04a430c4a6678fc"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7765516"},{"$numberLong":"6728199"},{"$numberLong":"8054864"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7372064"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"6912257"},{"$numberLong":"6888731"},{"$numberLong":"738341"},{"$numberLong":"7765561"},{"$numberLong":"7320414"},{"$numberLong":"7372065"},{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"6582404"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Therefore, it has become important to address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young programmers and older adult participants. In our paper we describe a case study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older adults to participate in software engineering processes.

This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Data mining', 'Detectors', 'Software systems', 'Software quality'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data mining', 'software maintenance', 'source code (software)'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structural smells', 'source code', 'textual analysis', 'code smell detection', 'textually detected code smells', 'textual smells', 'software maintenance', 'software evolution', 'software repository mining study'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical study', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453146","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Annibale Panichella;Andy Zaidman;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

Software developers may evolve UML models using merge relationships. However, given the growing heterogeneity of merge strategies and the UML limitations for expressing merge relationship, it is particularly challenging for them to specify merge relationships. Consequently, developers, end up expressing improperly merge relationships. Today, the UML can neither specify the semantics nor the order in which merge relationships must be performed. Developers are unable to specify the semantics and order in which merge relationships must be performed. This study, therefore, proposes UML2Merge, which is a UML extension for expressing merge relationship. The UML2Merge was evaluated through an empirical study with 10 participants for investigating its effects on the merge effort, the correctness of merge relationships, and the participant's acceptance. The collected data suggest that the UML2Merge is proper to express merge relationships by requiring a low merge effort, producing elevated correctness of merge relationships, and having a high acceptance of the participants. The results are encouraging and show the potential for using UML2Merge to express the evolution of UML models through merge relationships.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['software engineering', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['merge relationships', 'software developers', 'UML models', 'Unified Modelling Language models', 'model merging', 'UML extension', 'UML2Merge']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918147","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":5,"year":2019,"authors":"Kleinner Farias;Toacy Cavalcante de Oliveira;Lucian José Gonçales;Vinicius Bischoff","affiliations":"University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil;Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil;University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1306b04a430c4a667be2"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7965444"},{"$numberLong":"8241333"},{"$numberLong":"7930205"},{"$numberLong":"1000449"},{"$numberLong":"8324972"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

The aim is to close the gap between inheritance guidance and inheritance practice. It is based on detailed analyses of 2440 inheritance hierarchies drawn from 14 open-source systems. The original contributions made by this paper concern pragmatic assessment of inheritance hierarchy design quality. The findings show that inheritance is very widely used but that most of the usage patterns that occur in practice are simple in structure. They are so simple that they may not require much inheritance-specific design consideration. On the other hand, the majority of classes defined using inheritance actually appear within a relatively small number of large, complex hierarchies. While some of these large hierarchies appear to have a consistent structure, often based on a problem domain model or a design pattern, others do not. Another contribution is that the quality of hierarchies, especially the large problematic ones, may be assessed in practice based on size, shape, and the definition and invocation of novel methods - all properties that can be detected automatically.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Gold'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inheritance', 'object-oriented methods', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['inheritance hierarchies', 'complex hierarchies', 'inheritance-specific design consideration', 'inheritance hierarchy design quality', '14 open-source systems', 'inheritance guidance', 'object-oriented inheritance', 'inheritance usage patterns'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Object-oriented', 'inheritance', 'open source', 'empirical', 'design guidance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453083","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jamie Stevenson;Murray Wood","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput. \u0026 Inf.

Liveness is gaining attention among industrial and open-source communities; several IDEs offer high degrees of liveness. While several studies looked at how programmers work during software evolution tasks, none of them consider live environments. We conduct such a study based on an analysis of 17 programming sessions of practitioners using Pharo, a mature Live Programming environment. The study is complemented by a survey and subsequent analysis of 16 programming sessions in additional languages, e.g., JavaScript. We document the approaches taken by developers during their work. We find that some liveness features are extensively used, and have an impact on the way developers navigate source code and objects in their work.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Programming', 'Tools', 'Task analysis', 'Software', 'Programming environments', 'Navigation', 'Visualization'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'programming environments', 'public domain software', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['open-source communities', 'software evolution tasks', 'live environments', 'mature Live Programming environment', 'subsequent analysis', 'liveness features', 'programming sessions', 'developer navigate source code'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Live Programming', 'Software Evolution', 'Exploratory Study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453190","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Juraj Kubelka;Romain Robbes;Alexandre Bergel","affiliations":";;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813258"},{"$numberLong":"8904869"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

GitHub provides a characteristic feature notably pull request, and many projects adopt pull-based development model by using it. This development model offers an opportunity to review the source code before merging it into the mainstream. Getting acceptance of the pull request, any developer should strictly follow the flow of pull-based development. To follow the flow, she/he needs to use correctly Git commands. However, using these commands is complicated and requires further knowledge of them. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale survey of 1552 developers on GitHub to investigate the difficulty of the Git from the aspect of the pull request. The result shows developers struggle with 'git rebase -i' command tends not to perform re-ordering, compressing and dividing their commits.","conference":"International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Information science', 'Merging', 'Control systems', 'History', 'Software', 'Electronic mail', 'Conferences'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['configuration management', 'distributed programming', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['GitHub users', 'OSS project', 'version management', 'source code', 'Git repositories', 'pull request', 'pull-based development model', 'Git command']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7464545","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Yusuke Saito;Kenji Fujiwara;Hiroshi Igaki;Norihiro Yoshida;Hajimu Iida","affiliations":"Grad.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

This vocabulary mismatch problem can make code search inefficient. In this paper, we present Code voCaBulary (CoCaBu), an approach to resolving the vocabulary mismatch problem when dealing with free-form code search queries. Our approach leverages common developer questions and the associated expert answers to augment user queries with the relevant, but missing, structural code entities in order to improve the performance of matching relevant code examples within large code repositories. To instantiate this approach, we build GitSearch, a code search engine, on top of GitHub and Stack Overflow Q\u0026A data. We evaluate GitSearch in several dimensions to demonstrate that (1) its code search results are correct with respect to user-accepted answers; (2) the results are qualitatively better than those of existing Internet-scale code search engines; (3) our engine is competitive against web search engines, such as Google, in helping users solve programming tasks; and (4) GitSearch provides code examples that are acceptable or interesting to the community as answers for Stack Overflow questions.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Search engines', 'Software engineering', 'Vocabulary', 'Indexes', 'Programming', 'Engines', 'Natural languages'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'query processing', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'search engines'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structuring user queries', 'source code terms', 'search query', 'vocabulary mismatch problem', 'free-form code search queries', 'structural code entities', 'code repositories', 'GitSearch', 'user-accepted answers', 'web search engines', 'Internet-scale code search engines', 'expert answers', 'code vocabulary', 'CoCaBu', 'developer questions', 'stack overflow Q and A data', 'Google', 'programming tasks', 'user queries augmentation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code search', 'GitHub', 'Free form search', 'Query augmentation', 'StackOverflow', 'Vocabulary mismatch']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453173","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Raphael Sirres;Tegawendé F.

In recent years, especially for recent 3 years, many new defect prediction studies have been proposed. The goal of this study is to comprehensively review, analyse and discuss the state-of-the-art of defect prediction. The authors survey almost 70 representative defect prediction papers in recent years (January 2014-April 2017), most of which are published in the prominent software engineering journals and top conferences. The selected defect prediction papers are summarised to four aspects: machine learning-based prediction algorithms, manipulating the data, effort-aware prediction and empirical studies.

The identified challenges can give some practical guidelines for both software engineering researchers and practitioners in future software defect prediction.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['quality assurance', 'research and development', 'software quality', 'software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software defect prediction', 'software engineering journals', 'defect-prone software modules', 'software quality assurance', 'machine learning-based prediction algorithms', 'data manipulation', 'effort-aware prediction', 'empirical studies']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371784","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":39,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhiqiang Li;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Xiaoke Zhu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8689135"},{"$numberLong":"8719520"},{"$numberLong":"8747001"},{"$numberLong":"8758097"},{"$numberLong":"8946058"},{"$numberLong":"8978786"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"4027145"},{"$numberLong":"5611551"},{"$numberLong":"4408585"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"1702388"},{"$numberLong":"295895"},{"$numberLong":"5070510"},{"$numberLong":"7447797"},{"$numberLong":"5328803"},{"$numberLong":"6624058"},{"$numberLong":"6698911"},{"$numberLong":"6676898"},{"$numberLong":"5306304"},{"$numberLong":"6341763"},{"$numberLong":"7180126"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"},{"$numberLong":"4527256"},{"$numberLong":"4288197"},{"$numberLong":"6419712"},{"$numberLong":"6509481"},{"$numberLong":"7497471"},{"$numberLong":"7435328"},{"$numberLong":"6226427"},{"$numberLong":"7476658"},{"$numberLong":"6363444"},{"$numberLong":"4288196"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"7780202"},{"$numberLong":"6803085"},{"$numberLong":"6227194"},{"$numberLong":"5609530"},{"$numberLong":"6954519"},{"$numberLong":"4623684"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"7182807"}]},{"_id":"8572615","title":"Low-rank representation for semi-supervised software defect prediction","abstract":"Software defect prediction based on machine learning is an active research topic in the field of software engineering. The historical defect data in software repositories may contain noises because automatic defect collection is based on modified logs and defect reports. When the previous defect labels of modules are limited, predicting the defect-prone modules becomes a challenging problem. In this study, the authors propose a graph-based semi-supervised defect prediction approach to solve the problems of insufficient labelled data and noisy data. Graph-based semi-supervised learning methods used the labelled and unlabelled data simultaneously and consider them as the nodes of the graph at the training phase. Therefore, they solve the problem of insufficient labelled samples. To improve the stability of noisy defect data, a powerful clustering method, low-rank representation (LRR), and neighbourhood distance are used to construct the relationship graph of samples. Therefore, they propose a new semi-supervised defect prediction approach, named low-rank representation-based semi-supervised software defect prediction (LRRSSDP). The widely used datasets from NASA projects and noisy datasets are employed as test data to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that (i) LRRSSDP outperforms several representative state-of-the-art semi-supervised defect prediction methods; and (ii) LRRSSDP can maintain robustness in noisy environments.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['graph theory', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'pattern clustering', 'program diagnostics', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['semisupervised software defect prediction', 'software engineering', 'historical defect data', 'software repositories', 'automatic defect collection', 'defect reports', 'defect-prone modules', 'semisupervised defect prediction approach', 'insufficient labelled data', 'noisy data', 'unlabelled data', 'insufficient labelled samples', 'noisy defect data', 'low-rank representation', 'LRRSSDP']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8572615","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":15,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhi-Wu Zhang;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Fei Wu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China;State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8946058"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"4359365"},{"$numberLong":"4100780"},{"$numberLong":"7181433"},{"$numberLong":"1357896"},{"$numberLong":"1374211"},{"$numberLong":"5645567"},{"$numberLong":"6606585"},{"$numberLong":"7118181"},{"$numberLong":"6909883"},{"$numberLong":"6126422"},{"$numberLong":"7091958"},{"$numberLong":"7175026"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

The historical defect data in software repositories may contain noises because automatic defect collection is based on modified logs and defect reports. When the previous defect labels of modules are limited, predicting the defect-prone modules becomes a challenging problem. In this study, the authors propose a graph-based semi-supervised defect prediction approach to solve the problems of insufficient labelled data and noisy data. Graph-based semi-supervised learning methods used the labelled and unlabelled data simultaneously and consider them as the nodes of the graph at the training phase. Therefore, they solve the problem of insufficient labelled samples. To improve the stability of noisy defect data, a powerful clustering method, low-rank representation (LRR), and neighbourhood distance are used to construct the relationship graph of samples. Therefore, they propose a new semi-supervised defect prediction approach, named low-rank representation-based semi-supervised software defect prediction (LRRSSDP). The widely used datasets from NASA projects and noisy datasets are employed as test data to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that (i) LRRSSDP outperforms several representative state-of-the-art semi-supervised defect prediction methods; and (ii) LRRSSDP can maintain robustness in noisy environments.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['graph theory', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'pattern clustering', 'program diagnostics', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['semisupervised software defect prediction', 'software engineering', 'historical defect data', 'software repositories', 'automatic defect collection', 'defect reports', 'defect-prone modules', 'semisupervised defect prediction approach', 'insufficient labelled data', 'noisy data', 'unlabelled data', 'insufficient labelled samples', 'noisy defect data', 'low-rank representation', 'LRRSSDP']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8572615","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":15,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhi-Wu Zhang;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Fei Wu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China;State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8946058"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"4359365"},{"$numberLong":"4100780"},{"$numberLong":"7181433"},{"$numberLong":"1357896"},{"$numberLong":"1374211"},{"$numberLong":"5645567"},{"$numberLong":"6606585"},{"$numberLong":"7118181"},{"$numberLong":"6909883"},{"$numberLong":"6126422"},{"$numberLong":"7091958"},{"$numberLong":"7175026"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges. This paper is one of the results of the Shonan Seminar 118 on Modelling and Analysing Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems, which took place in December 2018.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Analytical models', 'Software engineering', 'Adaptation models', 'Ecosystems', 'Seminars', 'Software systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['cyber-physical systems', 'security of data', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['smart nations', 'software systems', 'physical environment', 'CPS', 'smart buildings', 'cyber-physical systems', 'medical devices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Cyber Physical Systems, Theoretical foundations of CPS, Adaptive methods for CPS, Exemplars of CPS']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8787077","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":11,"year":2019,"authors":"Amel Bennaceur;Carlo Ghezzi;Kenji Tei;Timo Kehrer;Danny Weyns;Radu Calinescu;Schahram Dustdar;Zhenjiang Hu;Shinichi Honiden;Fuyuki Ishikawa;Zhi Jin;Jeffrey Kramer;Marin Litoiu;Michele Loreti;Gabriel Moreno;Hausi Müller;Laura Nenzi;Bashar Nuseibeh;Liliana Pasquale;Wolfgang Reisig;Heinz Schmidt;Christos Tsigkanos;Haiyan Zhao","affiliations":"The Open University;Politecnico di Milano;National Institute of Informatics;Humboldt-University of Berlin;Katholieke Universiteit Leuven;University of York;Vienna University of Technology;National Institute of Informatics;National Institute of Informatics;National Institute of Informatics;Peking University;Imperial College London;York University;University of Camerino;Software Engineering Institute, CMU;University of Victoria;University of Trieste;The Open University (United Kingdom) \u0026 Lero (Ireland);University College Dublin Lero;Humboldt University Berlin;RMIT Australia;Vienna University of Technology;Peking University","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b4b04a430c4a667602"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8823762"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7368022"},{"$numberLong":"8008800"},{"$numberLong":"8220372"},{"$numberLong":"8220381"},{"$numberLong":"8767395"},{"$numberLong":"1249168"},{"$numberLong":"7842850"},{"$numberLong":"7542583"},{"$numberLong":"8115657"},{"$numberLong":"7281753"},{"$numberLong":"6224388"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

The crosscutting nature of these development tasks requires developers to maintain complex mental models and forces them (a) to manually split their high-level tasks into low-level commands that are supported by the various tools, and (b) to (re) establish their current context in each tool. In this paper we present Devy, a Conversational Developer Assistant (CDA) that enables developers to focus on their high-level development tasks. Devy reduces the number of manual, often complex, low-level commands that developers need to perform, freeing them to focus on their high-level tasks. Specifically, Devy infers high-level intent from developer's voice commands and combines this with an automatically-generated context model to determine appropriate workflows for invoking low-level tool actions; where needed, Devy can also prompt the developer for additional information. Through a mixed methods evaluation with 21 industrial developers, we found that Devy provided an intuitive interface that was able to support many development tasks while helping developers stay focused within their development environment. While industrial developers were largely supportive of the automation Devy enabled, they also provided insights into several other tasks and workflows CDAs could support to enable them to better focus on the important parts of their development tasks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Task analysis', 'Tools', 'Context', 'Context modeling', 'Software', 'Switches'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['interactive systems', 'software engineering', 'ubiquitous computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['high-level tasks', 'low-level commands', 'Devy', 'high-level development tasks', 'high-level intent', 'automatically-generated context model', 'low-level tool actions', 'development environment', 'context-aware conversational developer assistants', 'modern software systems'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Conversational Development Assistants', 'Natural User Interfaces']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453178","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Nick Bradley;Thomas Fritz;Reid Holmes","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Unfortunately, many websites are not designed to be mobile friendly. This results in problems such as unreadable text, cluttered navigation, and content over owing a device's viewport; all of which can lead to a frustrating and poor user experience. Existing techniques are limited in helping developers repair these mobile friendly problems. To address this limitation of prior work, we designed a novel automated approach for repairing mobile friendly problems in web pages. Our empirical evaluation showed that our approach was able to successfully resolve mobile friendly problems in 95% of the evaluation subjects. In a user study, participants preferred our repaired versions of the subjects and also considered the repaired pages to be more readable than the originals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Web pages', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Mobile handsets', 'Cascading style sheets', 'Layout', 'Navigation', 'Organizations'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer displays', 'Internet', 'mobile computing', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile devices', 'mobile friendly problems', 'Web pages', 'Internet', 'Websites', 'cluttered navigation', 'user experience'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile Friendly Problems', 'automated repair', 'web apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453072","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sonal Mahajan;Negarsadat Abolhassani;Phil McMinn;William G.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Servers', 'Security', 'Databases', 'Static analysis', 'Feature extraction'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile-app behaviors', 'EnMobile', 'benign apps', 'entity-based characterization', 'modern mobile malware', 'mobile platform', 'modern mobile apps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Analysis', 'Mobile Security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453096","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wei Yang;Mukul Prasad;Tao Xie","affiliations":";Fujitsu Labs. of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816783"},{"$numberLong":"8913874"},{"$numberLong":"8952382"},{"$numberLong":"8952509"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, on their own, both techniques suffer from scalability problems when considering the complexity of modern software. Hybrid testing methods attempt to mitigate these problems by leveraging dynamic symbolic execution to assist fuzz testing. Unfortunately, the efficiency of such methods is still limited by specific program structures and the schedule of seed files. In this study, the authors introduce a novel lazy symbolic pointer concretisation method and a symbolic loop bucket optimisation to mitigate path explosion caused by dynamic symbolic execution in hybrid testing. They also propose a distance-based seed selection method to rearrange the seed queue of the fuzzer engine in order to achieve higher coverage. They implemented a prototype and evaluate its ability to find vulnerabilities in software and cover new execution paths. They show on different benchmarks that it can find more crashes than other off-the-shelf vulnerability detection tools.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications.

Models can be defined using general-purpose modelling languages like the UML, but for particular domains, the use of domain-specific languages is pervasive. Either way, models must conform to a meta-model which defines their abstract syntax. In MDE, the definition of model management operations - often typed over project-specific meta-models - is recurrent. However, even if two operations are similar, they must be developed from scratch whenever they are applied to instances of different meta-models. This is so as operations defined (i.e., typed) over a meta-model cannot be directly reused for another. Part of this difficulty of reuse is because classes in meta-models are used in two ways: as templates to create objects and as static classifiers for them. These two aspects are inherently tied in most meta-modelling approaches, which results in unnecessarily rigid systems and hinders reusability of MDE artefacts. To enhance flexibility and reuse in MDE, we propose an approach to decouple object creation from typing [1]. The approach relies on standard mechanisms for object creation, and proposes the notion of a posteriori typing as a means to retype objects and enable multiple, partial, dynamic typings. A posteriori typing enhances flexibility because it allows models to be retyped with respect to other meta-models. Hence, we distinguish between creation meta-models used to construct models, and role meta-models into which models are retyped. This permits unanticipated reuse, as a model management operation defined for a role meta-model can be reused as-is with models built using a different creation meta-model, once such models are reclassified. Moreover, our approach permits expressing some types of bidirectional model transformations by reclassification. The transformations defined as reclassifications have better performance than the equivalent ones defined with traditional transformation languages, because reclassification does not require creating new objects. In [1], we propose two mechanisms to define a posteriori typings: type-level (mappings between meta-models) and instance-level (set of model queries). The paper presents the underlying theory and type correctness criteria of both mechanisms, defines some analysis methods, identifies practical restrictions for retyping specifications, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by an implementation atop our meta-modelling tool MetaDepth. We also explore application scenarios of a posteriori typing (to define transformations, for model transformation reuse, and to improve transformation expressiveness by dynamic type change), and present an experiment showing the potential performance gains when expressing transformations as retypings.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Unified modeling language', 'Software engineering', 'Model driven engineering', 'Analytical models', 'Tools', 'Domain specific languages', 'Syntactics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['formal specification', 'software engineering', 'software reusability', 'specification languages', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['posteriori typing', 'model transformation reuse', 'general-purpose modelling languages', 'model management operation', 'project-specific meta-models', 'meta-modelling approaches', 'creation meta-models', 'role meta-model', 'bidirectional model transformations', 'model queries', 'model-driven engineering', 'MetaDepth', 'meta-modelling tool'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Model-driven engineering', 'reuse', 'model typing', 'partial typing', 'dynamic typing', 'model transformations', 'bidirectionality', 'MetaDepth']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453194","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Juan de Lara;Esther Guerra","affiliations":"Modelling \u0026 Software Eng.

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons-missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data mining', 'Java', 'Software', 'Software reliability', 'Syntactics', 'Libraries'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'Java', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API misuse', 'API usage mining framework', 'potential API usage violations', 'API calls', 'alternative API usage details', 'Stack Overflow posts'], 'Author Keywords ': ['online Q\u0026A forums', 'API usage pattern', 'code example assessment']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453166","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Tianyi Zhang;Ganesha Upadhyaya;Anastasia Reinhardt;Hridesh Rajan;Miryung Kim","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8754426"},{"$numberLong":"8812028"},{"$numberLong":"8812042"},{"$numberLong":"8812114"},{"$numberLong":"8816735"},{"$numberLong":"8816757"},{"$numberLong":"8816758"},{"$numberLong":"8913924"},{"$numberLong":"8952239"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453127","title":"Data Scientists in Software Teams: State of the Art and Challenges","abstract":"The demand for analyzing large scale telemetry, machine, and quality data is rapidly increasing in software industry.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Recent work in this area has shown potential to save programmer time and reduce the risk of defects. Existing techniques focus on data structures for manipulating subsets of a single collection, but real-world programs often track multiple related collections and aggregate properties such as sums, counts, minimums, and maximums. This paper shows how to synthesize data structures that track subsets and aggregations of multiple related collections. Our technique decomposes the synthesis task into alternating steps of query synthesis and incrementalization. The query synthesis step implements pure operations over the data structure state by leveraging existing enumerative synthesis techniques, specialized to the data structures domain. The incrementalization step implements imperative state modifications by re-framing them as fresh queries that determine what to change, coupled with a small amount of code to apply the change. As an added benefit of this approach over previous work, the synthesized data structure is optimized for not only the queries in the specification but also the required update operations. We have evaluated our approach in four large case studies, demonstrating that these extensions are broadly applicable.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data structures', 'Synthesizers', 'Task analysis', 'Software', 'Servers', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data structures', 'query processing', 'reasoning about programs', 'set theory'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['data structure implementations', 'track subsets', 'incrementalization', 'data structure state', 'data structures domain', 'data structure synthesis', 'query synthesis', 'aggregations', 're-framing', 'code'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program synthesis', 'automatic programming', 'data structures']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453175","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Calvin Loncaric;Michael D.

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks.

Following this initial mock-up, the design artifacts are then handed off to developers whose goal is to accurately implement these GUIs and the desired functionality in code. Given the sizable abstraction gap between mock-ups and code, developers often introduce mistakes related to the GUI that can negatively impact an app's success in highly competitive marketplaces. Moreover, such mistakes are common in the evolutionary context of rapidly changing apps. This leads to the time-consuming and laborious task of design teams verifying that each screen of an app was implemented according to intended design specifications. This paper introduces a novel, automated approach for verifying whether the GUI of a mobile app was implemented according to its intended design. Our approach resolves GUI-related information from both implemented apps and mock-ups and uses computer vision techniques to identify common errors in the implementations of mobile GUIs. We implemented this approach for Android in a tool called GVT and carried out both a controlled empirical evaluation with open-source apps as well as an industrial evaluation with designers and developers from Huawei. The results show that GVT solves an important, difficult, and highly practical problem with remarkable efficiency and accuracy and is both useful and scalable from the point of view of industrial designers and developers. The tool is currently used by over one-thousand industrial designers and developers at Huawei to improve the quality of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Tools', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Visualization', 'Layout', 'Computer vision'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['graphical user interfaces', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['GUI design violations', 'mobile app', 'design artifacts', 'mock-ups', 'intended design specifications', 'open-source apps', 'mobile GUI'], 'Author Keywords ': ['GUI', 'design', 'Mobile Apps', 'Android', 'Computer Vision']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453076","citationCount":6,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kevin Moran;Boyang Li;Carlos Bernal-Cárdenas;Dan Jelf;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Tools', 'Java', 'Runtime', 'Open source software'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['hybrid RTS approach', 'granularity RTS', 'selected test ratio', 'offline testing time', 'method-level changes', 'instance method additions/deletions', 'file-level changes', 'online testing time', 'code changes', 'RTS techniques', 'hybrid regression test selection', 'regression testing cost reduction', 'HyRTS technique', 'FRTS'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test selection', 'Regression testing', 'Dynamic analysis', 'Empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453079","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingming Zhang","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730161"},{"$numberLong":"8730207"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8804429"},{"$numberLong":"8812109"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8812033"},{"$numberLong":"8854715"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

The simultaneous presence of these bugs may deteriorate the effectiveness of existing fault-localization techniques to locate program bugs. While it is acceptable to use all failed and successful tests to identify suspicious code for programs with exactly one bug, it is not appropriate to use the same approach for programs with multiple bugs because the due-to relationship between failed tests and underlying bugs cannot be easily identified. One solution is to generate fault-focused clusters by grouping failed tests caused by the same bug into the same clusters. We propose MSeer - an advanced fault localization technique for locating multiple bugs in parallel. Our major contributions include the use of (1) a revised Kendall tau distance to measure the distance between two failed tests, (2) an innovative approach to simultaneously estimate the number of clusters and assign initial medoids to these clusters, and (3) an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm to better identify the due-to relationship between failed tests and their corresponding bugs. Case studies on 840 multiple-bug versions of seven programs suggest that MSeer performs better in terms of effectiveness and efficiency than two other techniques for locating multiple bugs in parallel.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Computer science', 'Clustering algorithms', 'Measurement', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['parallel processing', 'pattern clustering', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['fault-focused clusters', 'failed tests', 'advanced fault localization technique', 'program bugs', 'bug locating', 'fault-localization techniques', 'K-medoids clustering', 'MSeer'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software fault localization', 'parallel debugging', 'multiple bugs', 'clustering', 'distance metrics']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453186","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Ruizhi Gao;W.

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx.

This is because proper preprocessing of imbalanced data can enable researchers to reduce defects as much as possible, which, in turn, may lead to the elimination of defects in existing data sets. Despite the remarkable achievements that have been accomplished in machine learning studies, systematic literature reviews of imbalanced data preprocessing techniques are lacking. Consequently, there are a limited number of systematic literature review studies on imbalanced data preprocessing. In this study, the authors assess the existing literature to identify the key issues related to data quality and handling and to provide a convenient collection of the techniques used to address these issues when performing data preprocessing. They applied a systematic literature review method involving a manual search to select articles published from January 2010 to September 2018 for review. The qualities of the existing studies were assessed using certain quality assessment criteria. Of the 118 relevant studies found, only 2% were identified as having been conducted following systematic literature review guidelines. This study, therefore, calls for more systematic literature review studies on data preprocessing to improve the quality of the data applied in machine learning studies.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['learning (artificial intelligence)', 'reviews'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['quality assessment criteria', 'defect reduction', 'imbalanced data preprocessing techniques', 'machine learning', 'data quality', 'data sets', 'systematic literature review guidelines', 'systematic literature review method']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918216","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":59,"year":2019,"authors":"Ebubeogu Amarachukwu Felix;Sai Peck Lee","affiliations":"University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1306b04a430c4a667be2"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"5978225"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7675460"},{"$numberLong":"7027524"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7990255"},{"$numberLong":"8097045"},{"$numberLong":"6468038"},{"$numberLong":"7550920"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"6299324"},{"$numberLong":"5467094"},{"$numberLong":"6747166"},{"$numberLong":"7959597"},{"$numberLong":"977291"},{"$numberLong":"7409958"},{"$numberLong":"391407"},{"$numberLong":"8168387"},{"$numberLong":"6227909"},{"$numberLong":"6035700"},{"$numberLong":"6674958"},{"$numberLong":"7194627"},{"$numberLong":"6976088"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"8058420"},{"$numberLong":"4021972"},{"$numberLong":"1019484"},{"$numberLong":"6909884"},{"$numberLong":"7589046"},{"$numberLong":"6406734"},{"$numberLong":"7395717"},{"$numberLong":"7109937"},{"$numberLong":"6766252"},{"$numberLong":"6816044"},{"$numberLong":"7397461"},{"$numberLong":"7022596"},{"$numberLong":"7378029"},{"$numberLong":"7483438"},{"$numberLong":"7273627"},{"$numberLong":"6761610"},{"$numberLong":"7312601"},{"$numberLong":"6993364"},{"$numberLong":"6706947"},{"$numberLong":"6735345"},{"$numberLong":"6699499"},{"$numberLong":"6701493"},{"$numberLong":"5584797"},{"$numberLong":"6703916"},{"$numberLong":"6107280"},{"$numberLong":"6089335"},{"$numberLong":"6510325"},{"$numberLong":"6212686"},{"$numberLong":"5706568"},{"$numberLong":"5596308"},{"$numberLong":"5708951"},{"$numberLong":"5594922"},{"$numberLong":"6083167"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, there is no consensus on which type of representation better supports the comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey's cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies performed in two countries with 69 and 83 participants respectively, in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models. Conclusions: Our findings can be explained by Vessey's cognitive fit theory as tabular models implicitly capture elementary linear spatial relationships. Interest for ICSE: It is almost taken for granted in Software Engineering that graphical-, diagram-based models are \"the\" way to go (e.g., the SE Body of Knowledge). This paper provides some experimental-based doubts that this might not always be the case. It will provide an interesting debate that might ripple to traditional requirements and design notations outside security.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Security', 'Task analysis', 'Unified modeling language', 'Software engineering', 'Risk management', 'Data mining', 'Complexity theory'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['risk analysis', 'risk management', 'security of data', 'software engineering', 'solid modelling'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['comprehension questions', \"Vessey's cognitive fit theory\", 'elementary linear spatial relationships', 'diagram-based models', 'security risk assessment', 'graphical representations', 'security controls', 'security risks', 'tabular risk models', 'model comprehension', 'Software Engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical Study', 'Security Risk Assessment', 'Risk Modeling', 'Comprehensibility', 'Cognitive Fit']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453097","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Katsiaryna Labunets;Fabio Massacci;Federica Paci;Sabrina Marczak;Flávio Moreira de Oliveira","affiliations":"Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy;Univ. of Southampton, Southampton, UK;Pontificia Univ.

By ignoring the temporal aspects of an attack during the analysis and enforcement, the state-of-the-art approaches aimed at protecting the users against such attacks are prone to have low-coverage in detection and high-disruption in prevention of permission-induced attacks. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we present TERMINATOR, a temporal permission analysis and enforcement framework for Android. Leveraging temporal logic model checking, TERMINATOR's analyzer identifies permission-induced threats with respect to dynamic permission states of the apps. At runtime, TERMINATOR's enforcer selectively leases (i.e., temporarily grants) permissions to apps when the system is in a safe state, and revokes the permissions when the system moves to an unsafe state realizing the identified threats. The results of our experiments, conducted over thousands of apps, indicate that TERMINATOR is able to provide an effective, yet non-disruptive defense against permission-induced attacks. We also show that our approach, which does not require modification to the Android framework or apps' implementation logic, is highly reliable and widely applicable.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Security', 'Informatics', 'Malware', 'Analytical models', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'authorisation', 'data privacy', 'temporal logic'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission misuse', 'temporal aspects', 'permission-induced attacks', 'temporal permission analysis', 'enforcement framework', 'temporal logic model checking', 'permission-induced threats', 'dynamic permission states', 'Android framework', 'TERMINATOR enforcer'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Access Control (Permission)', 'Temporal Logic']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453158","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Alireza Sadeghi;Reyhaneh Jabbarvand;Negar Ghorbani;Hamid Bagheri;Sam Malek","affiliations":"Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Inf., Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA;Dept. of Comput.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be generated, without blocking any correct patches.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Search problems', 'Software', 'Computer crashes', 'Null value', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['automatic programming', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying patch correctness', 'test-based program repair', 'automatic program repair', 'incorrect patches', 'generated patches', 'behavior similarity', 'test case executions', 'passing tests', 'original programs', 'patched programs', 'similar runtime behavior', 'correct patches', 'program repair systems', 'jGenProg'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test based program repair', 'patch correctness', 'patch classification', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453152","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Yingfei Xiong;Xinyuan Liu;Muhan Zeng;Lu Zhang;Gang Huang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8812054"},{"$numberLong":"8805696"},{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8918958"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453068","title":"Identifying Features in Forks","abstract":"Fork-based development has been widely used both in open source communities and in industry, because it gives developers flexibility to modify their own fork without affecting others. Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides: When the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Feature extraction', 'Computer bugs', 'Navigation', 'History', 'Tools', 'Visualization', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['feature extraction', 'information retrieval', 'pattern clustering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying features', 'fork-based development', 'open source communities', 'INFOX', 'nonmerged features', 'clusters cohesive code fragments', 'network-analysis techniques', 'information-retrieval techniques', 'human-subject evaluation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Fork-based development', 'Github', 'Community detection', 'Information retrieval', 'overview of forks', 'transparency']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453068","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shurui Zhou;Stefan Stanciulescu;Olaf Leßenich;Yingfei Xiong;Andrzej Wasowski;Christian Kästner","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"},{"$numberLong":"8952413"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

Consequently, familiarity is an important factor in many contexts of software development, especially for maintenance and program comprehension. As a result, familiarity is considered to some extent in many different approaches, for example, to model costs or to identify experts. Still, all approaches we are aware of require a manual assessment of familiarity and empirical analyses of forgetting in software development are missing. In this paper, we address this issue with an empirical study that we conducted with 60 open-source developers. We used a survey to receive information on the developers' familiarity and analyze the responses based on data we extract from their used version control systems. The results show that forgetting is an important factor when considering familiarity and program comprehension of developers. We find that a forgetting curve is partly applicable for software development, investigate three factors - the number of edits, ratio of owned code, and tracking behavior - that can impact familiarity with code, and derive a general memory strength for our participants. Our findings can be used to scope approaches that have to consider familiarity and they provide insights into forgetting in the context of software development.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Task analysis', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Psychology', 'Software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['configuration management', 'software development management', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'software development', 'owned code', 'open-source developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['familiarity', 'forgetting', 'empirical study', 'maintenance', 'program comprehension', 'expert identification', 'knowledge management']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453149","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jacob Krüger;Jens Wiemann;Wolfram Fenske;Gunter Saake;Thomas Leich","affiliations":"Harz Univ. of Appl.

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453159","title":"Global-Aware Recommendations for Repairing Violations in Exception Handling","abstract":"This paper presents an extended abstract incorporated as a journalrst paper into the ICSE'18 program.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Software engineering', 'Software maintenance', 'Java', 'Tools', 'Recommender systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['exception handling', 'object-oriented programming', 'program diagnostics', 'recommender systems'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['global-aware recommendations', 'repairing violations', 'journalrst paper', 'exception handling'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Exception Handling', 'Recommender system', 'Software maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453159","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Eiji Adachi Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia","affiliations":"Digital Metropolis Inst., UFRN, Natal, Brazil;Inf.

Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven's default flaky test detector.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Monitoring', 'Testing', 'Java', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Syntactics', 'Detectors'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing', 'public domain software', 'regression analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DeFlaker', 'test failure', 'unknown flaky tests'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'flaky tests', 'code coverage']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453104","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jonathan Bell;Owolabi Legunsen;Michael Hilton;Lamyaa Eloussi;Tifany Yung;Darko Marinov","affiliations":"George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA;Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719555"},{"$numberLong":"8730188"},{"$numberLong":"8730172"},{"$numberLong":"8804462"},{"$numberLong":"8812073"},{"$numberLong":"8821891"},{"$numberLong":"8952328"},{"$numberLong":"8987498"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Display represents a significant portion of an app's energy consumption. However, developers lack techniques to identify the user interfaces in their apps for which energy needs to be improved. In this paper, we present a technique for detecting display energy hotspots - user interfaces of a mobile app whose energy consumption is greater than optimal. Our technique leverages display power modeling and automated display transformation techniques to detect these hotspots and prioritize them for developers. In an evaluation on a set of popular Android apps, our technique was very accurate in both predicting energy consumption and ranking the display energy hotspots. Our approach was also able to detect display energy hotspots in 398 Android market apps, showing its effectiveness and the pervasiveness of the problem. These results indicate that our approach represents a potentially useful technique for helping developers to detect energy related problems and reduce the energy consumption of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Color', 'Energy consumption', 'User interfaces', 'Power demand', 'Mobile communication', 'Smart phones', 'Monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'power aware computing', 'user interfaces'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['display energy hotspots detection', 'user interfaces', 'mobile app', 'energy consumption', 'display power modeling', 'automated display transformation techniques', 'Android market apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102585","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":6,"year":2015,"authors":"Mian Wan;Yuchen Jin;Ding Li;William G.

Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic. Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE. Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques. Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Analytical models', 'Unified modeling language', 'Stakeholders', 'Collaborative software', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'groupware', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collaborative model-driven software engineering', 'CoSE', 'UML-based approach', 'decision making', 'understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches', 'model-driven engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Collaborative MDSE', 'CoMDSE', 'C MDSE', 'model driven engineering', 'collaborative software engineering', 'CoSE', 'systematic mapping study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453119","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Davide Di Ruscio;Mirco Franzago;Ivano Malavolta;Henry Muccini","affiliations":"DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;DISIM Dept., Univ. of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;Vrije Univ.

However, current approaches either do not account for correlations between object fields or do so in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we introduce the problem of composite constant propagation. We develop the first generic solver that infers all possible values of complex objects in an interprocedural, flow and context-sensitive manner, taking field correlations into account. Composite constant propagation problems are specified using COAL, a declarative language. We apply our COAL solver to the problem of inferring Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) values, which is required to understand how the components of Android applications interact. Using COAL, we model ICC objects in Android more thoroughly than the state-of-the-art. We compute ICC values for 460 applications from the Play store. The ICC values we infer are substantially more precise than previous work. The analysis is efficient, taking slightly over two minutes per application on average. While this work can be used as the basis for many whole-program analyses of Android applications, the COAL solver can also be used to infer the values of composite objects in many other contexts.","conference":"IEEE/ACM IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Coal', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Data models', 'Analytical models', 'Computational modeling', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['mobile computing', 'program diagnostics', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['composite constant propagation', 'Android application', 'intercomponent communication analysis', 'ICC', 'program analysis', 'COAL solver', 'declarative language'], 'Author Keywords ': ['inter-component communication', 'composite constant', 'constant propagation', 'Android', 'Android IPC', 'Android ICC']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194563","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Damien Octeau;Daniel Luchaup;Matthew Dering;Somesh Jha;Patrick McDaniel","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Decision propagation enables a backtracking-free configuration process by computing values implied by user decisions. However, employing decision propagation for large-scale systems is a time-consuming task and, thus, can be a bottleneck in interactive configuration processes and analyses alike.

Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

It aims to predict defect-prone software modules before defects are discovered, therefore it can be used to better prioritise software quality assurance effort. In recent years, especially for recent 3 years, many new defect prediction studies have been proposed. The goal of this study is to comprehensively review, analyse and discuss the state-of-the-art of defect prediction. The authors survey almost 70 representative defect prediction papers in recent years (January 2014-April 2017), most of which are published in the prominent software engineering journals and top conferences. The selected defect prediction papers are summarised to four aspects: machine learning-based prediction algorithms, manipulating the data, effort-aware prediction and empirical studies. The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building methods and many research opportunities exist. The identified challenges can give some practical guidelines for both software engineering researchers and practitioners in future software defect prediction.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['quality assurance', 'research and development', 'software quality', 'software reliability'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software defect prediction', 'software engineering journals', 'defect-prone software modules', 'software quality assurance', 'machine learning-based prediction algorithms', 'data manipulation', 'effort-aware prediction', 'empirical studies']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371784","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":39,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhiqiang Li;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Xiaoke Zhu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8689135"},{"$numberLong":"8719520"},{"$numberLong":"8747001"},{"$numberLong":"8758097"},{"$numberLong":"8946058"},{"$numberLong":"8978786"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"4027145"},{"$numberLong":"5611551"},{"$numberLong":"4408585"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"1702388"},{"$numberLong":"295895"},{"$numberLong":"5070510"},{"$numberLong":"7447797"},{"$numberLong":"5328803"},{"$numberLong":"6624058"},{"$numberLong":"6698911"},{"$numberLong":"6676898"},{"$numberLong":"5306304"},{"$numberLong":"6341763"},{"$numberLong":"7180126"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"},{"$numberLong":"4527256"},{"$numberLong":"4288197"},{"$numberLong":"6419712"},{"$numberLong":"6509481"},{"$numberLong":"7497471"},{"$numberLong":"7435328"},{"$numberLong":"6226427"},{"$numberLong":"7476658"},{"$numberLong":"6363444"},{"$numberLong":"4288196"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"7780202"},{"$numberLong":"6803085"},{"$numberLong":"6227194"},{"$numberLong":"5609530"},{"$numberLong":"6954519"},{"$numberLong":"4623684"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"7182807"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453120","title":"[Journal First] ChangeLocator: Locate Crash-Inducing Changes Based on Crash Reports","abstract":"Software crashes are severe manifestations of software bugs. Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

App reviews provide an opportunity to proactively collect user complaints and promptly improve apps' user experience, in terms of bug fixing and feature refinement. However, the tremendous quantities of reviews and noise words (e.g., misspelled words) increase the difficulties in accurately identifying newly-appearing app issues. In this paper, we propose a novel and automated framework IDEA, which aims to IDentify Emerging App issues effectively based on online review analysis. We evaluate IDEA on six popular apps from Google Play and Apple's App Store, employing the official app changelogs as our ground truth. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of IDEA in identifying emerging app issues. Feedback from engineers and product managers shows that 88.9% of them think that the identified issues can facilitate app development in practice. Moreover, we have successfully applied IDEA to several products of Tencent, which serve hundreds of millions of users.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Meteorology', 'Facebook', 'Google', 'Semantics', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['noise words', 'emerging app issues', 'IDEA', 'popular apps', 'official app changelogs', 'app development', 'online App review analysis', 'App reviews', 'Apple App Store'], 'Author Keywords ': ['app reviews', 'online analysis', 'emerging issues']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453061","citationCount":7,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Cuiyun Gao;Jichuan Zeng;Michael R.

Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Web APIs are rapidly proliferating as a key element to foster reusability, integration, and innovation, enabling new consumption models such as mobile or smart TV apps. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, eBay or Netflix receive billions of API calls every day from thousands of different third-party applications and devices, which constitutes more than half of their total traffic. As Web APIs are progressively becoming the cornerstone of software integration, their validation is getting more critical. In this context, the fast detection of bugs is of utmost importance to increase the quality of internal products and third-party applications. However, testing Web APIs is challenging mainly due to the difficulty to assess whether the output of an API call is correct, i.e., the oracle problem. For instance, consider the Web API of the popular music streaming service Spotify. Suppose a search for albums with the query \"redhouse\" returning 21 total matches: Is this output correct? Do all the albums in the result set contain the keyword? Are there any albums containing the keyword not included in the result set? Answering these questions is difficult, even with small result sets, and often infeasible when the results are counted by thousands or millions. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by providing an alternative when the expected output of a test execution is complex or unknown. Rather than checking the output of an individual program execution, metamorphic testing checks whether multiple executions of the program under test fulfil certain necessary properties called metamorphic relations. For instance, consider the following metamorphic relation in Spotify: two searches for albums with the same query should return the same number of total results regardless of the size of pagination. Suppose that a new Spotify search is performed using the exact same query as before and increasing the maximum number of results per page from 20 (default value) to 50: This search returns 27 total albums (6 more matches than in the previous search), which reveals a bug. This is an example of a real and reproducible fault detected using the approach presented in this paper and reported to Spotify. According to Spotify developers, it was a regression fault caused by a fix with undesired side effects. In this paper [1], we present a metamorphic testing approach for the automated detection of faults in RESTful Web APIs (henceforth also referred to as simply Web APIs). We introduce the concept of metamorphic relation output patterns. A Metamorphic Relation Output Pattern (MROP) defines an abstract output relation typically identified in Web APIs, regardless of their application domain. Each MROP is defined in terms of set operations among test outputs such as equality, union, subset, or intersection. MROPs provide a helpful guide for the identification of metamorphic relations, broadening the scope of our work beyond a particular Web API. Based on the notion of MROP, a methodology is proposed for the application of the approach to any Web API following the REST architectural pattern. The approach was evaluated in several steps. First, we used the proposed methodology to identify 33 metamorphic relations in four Web APIs developed by undergraduate students. All the relations are instances of the proposed MROPs. Then, we assessed the effectiveness of the identified relations at revealing 317 automatically seeded faults (i.e., mutants) in the APIs under test. As a result, 302 seeded faults were detected, achieving a mutation score of 95.3%. Second, we evaluated the approach using real Web APIs and faults. In particular, we identified 20 metamorphic relations in the Web API of Spotify and 40 metamorphic relations in the Web API of YouTube. Each metamorphic relation was implemented and automatically executed using both random and manual test data. In total, 469K metamorphic tests were generated. As a result, 21 metamorphic relations were violated, and 11 issues revealed and reported (3 issues in Spotify and 8 issues in YouTube). To date, 10 of the reported issues have been either confirmed by the API developers or reproduced by other users supporting the effectiveness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Computer bugs', 'YouTube', 'Computer languages', 'Technological innovation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'program testing', 'Web services'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['metamorphic relation output pattern', 'RESTful Web API', 'MROP', 'metamorphic testing', 'REST architectural pattern'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Metamorphic testing', 'REST', 'RESTful Web services', 'Web API']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453162","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sergio Segura;José A.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Servers', 'Security', 'Databases', 'Static analysis', 'Feature extraction'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile-app behaviors', 'EnMobile', 'benign apps', 'entity-based characterization', 'modern mobile malware', 'mobile platform', 'modern mobile apps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Analysis', 'Mobile Security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453096","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wei Yang;Mukul Prasad;Tao Xie","affiliations":";Fujitsu Labs. of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816783"},{"$numberLong":"8913874"},{"$numberLong":"8952382"},{"$numberLong":"8952509"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This popularity coupled with user data collection by Android apps has made privacy protection a well-known challenge in the Android ecosystem. In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

While there have been many tools to mitigate UAF vulnerabilities, UAF remains one of the most common attack vectors. UAF is particularly di cult to detect in concurrent programs, in which a UAF may only occur with rare thread schedules. In this paper, we present a novel technique, UFO, that can precisely predict UAFs based on a single observed execution trace with a provably higher detection capability than existing techniques with no false positives. The key technical advancement of UFO is an extended maximal thread causality model that captures the largest possible set of feasible traces that can be inferred from a given multithreaded execution trace. By formulating UAF detection as a constraint solving problem atop this model, we can explore a much larger thread scheduling space than classical happens-before based techniques. We have evaluated UFO on several real-world large complex C/C++ programs including Chromium and FireFox.

Here, the programmer starts by writing a \"draft\" that mixes un nished code, natural language comments, and correctness requirements. A program synthesizer that interacts with a large, searchable database of program snippets is used to automatically complete the draft into a program that meets the re-quirements. The synthesis process happens in two stages. First, the synthesizer identi es a small number of programs in the database that are relevant to the synthesis task. Next it uses an enumerative search to systematically ll the draft with expressions and statements from these relevant programs. The resulting program is returned to the programmer, who can modify it and possibly invoke additional rounds of synthesis. We present an implementation of program splicing, called Splicer, for the Java programming language. Splicer uses a corpus of over 3.5 million procedures from an open-source software repository. Our evaluation uses the system in a suite of everyday programming tasks, and includes a comparison with a state-of-the-art competing approach as well as a user study.

When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil\u0026Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Most important of these is the need for benchmark programs with reproducible, important defects and a deterministic method for assessing if those defects have been repaired. This article details the need for a new set of benchmarks, outlines requirements, and then presents two datasets, ManyBugs and IntroClass, consisting between them of 1,183 defects in 15 C programs. Each dataset is designed to support the comparative evaluation of automatic repair algorithms asking a variety of experimental questions. The datasets have empirically defined guarantees of reproducibility and benchmark quality, and each study object is categorized to facilitate qualitative evaluation and comparisons by category of bug or program.

Our empirical evaluation showed that our approach was able to successfully resolve mobile friendly problems in 95% of the evaluation subjects. In a user study, participants preferred our repaired versions of the subjects and also considered the repaired pages to be more readable than the originals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Web pages', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Mobile handsets', 'Cascading style sheets', 'Layout', 'Navigation', 'Organizations'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer displays', 'Internet', 'mobile computing', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile devices', 'mobile friendly problems', 'Web pages', 'Internet', 'Websites', 'cluttered navigation', 'user experience'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile Friendly Problems', 'automated repair', 'web apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453072","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sonal Mahajan;Negarsadat Abolhassani;Phil McMinn;William G.

Display represents a significant portion of an app's energy consumption. However, developers lack techniques to identify the user interfaces in their apps for which energy needs to be improved. In this paper, we present a technique for detecting display energy hotspots - user interfaces of a mobile app whose energy consumption is greater than optimal. Our technique leverages display power modeling and automated display transformation techniques to detect these hotspots and prioritize them for developers. In an evaluation on a set of popular Android apps, our technique was very accurate in both predicting energy consumption and ranking the display energy hotspots. Our approach was also able to detect display energy hotspots in 398 Android market apps, showing its effectiveness and the pervasiveness of the problem. These results indicate that our approach represents a potentially useful technique for helping developers to detect energy related problems and reduce the energy consumption of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Color', 'Energy consumption', 'User interfaces', 'Power demand', 'Mobile communication', 'Smart phones', 'Monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'power aware computing', 'user interfaces'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['display energy hotspots detection', 'user interfaces', 'mobile app', 'energy consumption', 'display power modeling', 'automated display transformation techniques', 'Android market apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102585","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":6,"year":2015,"authors":"Mian Wan;Yuchen Jin;Ding Li;William G.

Existing composition strategies rarely address the influence of the environment, which may influence QoS and thus lead to sub-optimal composition policies in a dynamic environment. In this study, a model-based service composition approach is proposed. Given the user request, it is possible to first find a set of matching abstract web services (AWSs), and then pull relevant concrete web services (CWSs) based on the AWSs. The set of CWSs can be modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). In addition, the authors model the environment as a fully probabilistic system, capturing changes of environment probabilistically. The environment model can be further composed of the MDP from the service models, obtaining a monolithic MDP. They demonstrate how the probabilistic verification techniques can be used to find the optimal service selection strategy against their QoS and the environment change. A distinguishing feature of their approach is that the QoS, as well as the dynamic of environment change, is made parametric so that the formal analysis is adaptive to the environment which is of paramount importance for autonomous and self-adaptive systems.

Past work focused on automated test generation to detect crashes in Android apps. However, automated repair of crashes has not been studied. In this paper, we propose the first approach to automatically repair Android apps, specifically we propose a technique for fixing crashes in Android apps. Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions).

Prior works show the feasibility of automated repair, and the research focus is gradually shifting towards the quality of generated patches. One promising direction is to control the quality of generated patches by controlling the quality of test-suites used. In this paper, we investigate the question: \"\"Can traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing be used for automated program repair?\"\". We empirically investigate the effectiveness of test-suite metrics (statement / branch coverage and mutation score) in controlling the reliability of repairs (the likelihood that repairs cause regressions). We conduct the largest-scale experiments to date with real-world software, and perform the first correlation study between test-suite metrics and the reliability of generated repairs. Our results show that by increasing test-suite metrics, the reliability of repairs tend to increase. Particularly, such trend is most strongly observed in statement coverage. This implies that traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing can also be used to improve the reliability of repairs in program repair.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Measurement', 'Correlation', 'Software reliability', 'Software', 'Software testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['regressions', 'test-suite metrics', 'automated repair', 'generated repairs', 'correlation study', 'automated program repair', 'software testing', 'test-suites', 'generated patches'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code Coverage', 'Program Repair', 'Mutation Testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453057","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jooyong Yi;Shin Hwei Tan;Sergey Mechtaev;Marcel Böhme;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code.

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups' evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups' assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup's evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Companies', 'Interviews', 'Software', 'Biological system modeling', 'Turning', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['organisational aspects', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['requirements artefacts', 'engineering practices', 'maturing startups', 'practical insights', 'software startups', 'systematic requirement analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['requirements engineering', 'startups', 'evolution', 'grounded theory']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453156","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Catarina Gralha;Daniela Damian;Anthony Wasserman;Miguel Goulão;João Araújo","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8933680"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil\u0026Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

What would it take to change your mind? That's essentially the dilemma faced by advocates of test-driven development (TDD). The TDD paradigm argues that the basic cycle of developing code and then testing it to make sure it does what it's supposed to do-something drilled into most of us from the time we began learning software development- isn't the most effective approach. TDD replaces the traditional \"code then test\" cycle. First, you develop test cases for a small increment of functionality; then you write code that makes those tests run correctly. After each increment, you refactor the code to maintain code quality.","conference":"IEEE Software","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'software maintenance', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['test driven development', 'code development', 'software development', 'code refactoring', 'code quality'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software engineering']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5604358","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":1,"year":2010,"authors":"Forrest Shull;Grigori Melnik;Burak Turhan;Lucas Layman;Madeline Diep;Hakan Erdogmus","affiliations":"University of Maryland;Microsoft;University of Oulu;University of Maryland;University of Nebraska-Lincoln;Kalemun Research","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c1b04a430c4a667800"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"6005486"},{"$numberLong":"6612871"},{"$numberLong":"6298092"},{"$numberLong":"7360030"},{"$numberLong":"7833380"},{"$numberLong":"6681343"},{"$numberLong":"7005209"},{"$numberLong":"7427895"},{"$numberLong":"7194615"},{"$numberLong":"6111358"},{"$numberLong":"6336718"},{"$numberLong":"5707981"},{"$numberLong":"7934714"},{"$numberLong":"6197200"},{"$numberLong":"8405634"},{"$numberLong":"8719427"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"4163024"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Existing composition strategies rarely address the influence of the environment, which may influence QoS and thus lead to sub-optimal composition policies in a dynamic environment. In this study, a model-based service composition approach is proposed. Given the user request, it is possible to first find a set of matching abstract web services (AWSs), and then pull relevant concrete web services (CWSs) based on the AWSs. The set of CWSs can be modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). In addition, the authors model the environment as a fully probabilistic system, capturing changes of environment probabilistically. The environment model can be further composed of the MDP from the service models, obtaining a monolithic MDP. They demonstrate how the probabilistic verification techniques can be used to find the optimal service selection strategy against their QoS and the environment change. A distinguishing feature of their approach is that the QoS, as well as the dynamic of environment change, is made parametric so that the formal analysis is adaptive to the environment which is of paramount importance for autonomous and self-adaptive systems. Examples and experiments confirm the feasibility of their approach.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['decision theory', 'Markov processes', 'quality of service', 'Web services'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['matching abstract Web services', 'composition policy adoption', 'concrete Web services', 'environment change', 'optimal service selection strategy', 'probabilistic verification techniques', 'service models', 'environment model', 'probabilistic system', 'MDP', 'CWS', 'AWS', 'model-based service composition approach', 'dynamic environment', 'sub-optimal composition policies', 'crucial indicator', 'quality-of-service', 'value-added services', 'explicit environment models', 'QoS-aware service composition', 'probabilistic analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986853","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":12,"year":2020,"authors":"Yu Zhou;Tingting Han;Taolue Chen;Shiqi Zhou","affiliations":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, People's Republic of China;University of London, Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Birkbeck, UK;Nanjing University, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China;College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12ccb04a430c4a6678fc"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6807777"},{"$numberLong":"6874541"},{"$numberLong":"7195563"},{"$numberLong":"6928930"},{"$numberLong":"8029822"},{"$numberLong":"7273959"},{"$numberLong":"7226718"},{"$numberLong":"8115708"},{"$numberLong":"7558056"},{"$numberLong":"7558058"},{"$numberLong":"7192623"},{"$numberLong":"8029740"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This popularity coupled with user data collection by Android apps has made privacy protection a well-known challenge in the Android ecosystem. In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We extensively compare MAHAKIL with five other sampling approaches using 20 releases of defect datasets from the PROMISE repository and five prediction models.

Modelling and analyzing requirements models of PLs allows for early detection and correction of requirements errors -- including unintended feature interactions, which are a serious problem in feature-rich systems. A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms. In this paper we develop PL model checking using two leading SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithms: IMC and IC3. We describe the algorithms, prove their correctness, and report on our implementation.

This is because proper preprocessing of imbalanced data can enable researchers to reduce defects as much as possible, which, in turn, may lead to the elimination of defects in existing data sets. Despite the remarkable achievements that have been accomplished in machine learning studies, systematic literature reviews of imbalanced data preprocessing techniques are lacking. Consequently, there are a limited number of systematic literature review studies on imbalanced data preprocessing. In this study, the authors assess the existing literature to identify the key issues related to data quality and handling and to provide a convenient collection of the techniques used to address these issues when performing data preprocessing. They applied a systematic literature review method involving a manual search to select articles published from January 2010 to September 2018 for review. The qualities of the existing studies were assessed using certain quality assessment criteria. Of the 118 relevant studies found, only 2% were identified as having been conducted following systematic literature review guidelines. This study, therefore, calls for more systematic literature review studies on data preprocessing to improve the quality of the data applied in machine learning studies.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['learning (artificial intelligence)', 'reviews'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['quality assessment criteria', 'defect reduction', 'imbalanced data preprocessing techniques', 'machine learning', 'data quality', 'data sets', 'systematic literature review guidelines', 'systematic literature review method']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918216","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":59,"year":2019,"authors":"Ebubeogu Amarachukwu Felix;Sai Peck Lee","affiliations":"University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1306b04a430c4a667be2"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"5978225"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7675460"},{"$numberLong":"7027524"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7990255"},{"$numberLong":"8097045"},{"$numberLong":"6468038"},{"$numberLong":"7550920"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"6299324"},{"$numberLong":"5467094"},{"$numberLong":"6747166"},{"$numberLong":"7959597"},{"$numberLong":"977291"},{"$numberLong":"7409958"},{"$numberLong":"391407"},{"$numberLong":"8168387"},{"$numberLong":"6227909"},{"$numberLong":"6035700"},{"$numberLong":"6674958"},{"$numberLong":"7194627"},{"$numberLong":"6976088"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"8058420"},{"$numberLong":"4021972"},{"$numberLong":"1019484"},{"$numberLong":"6909884"},{"$numberLong":"7589046"},{"$numberLong":"6406734"},{"$numberLong":"7395717"},{"$numberLong":"7109937"},{"$numberLong":"6766252"},{"$numberLong":"6816044"},{"$numberLong":"7397461"},{"$numberLong":"7022596"},{"$numberLong":"7378029"},{"$numberLong":"7483438"},{"$numberLong":"7273627"},{"$numberLong":"6761610"},{"$numberLong":"7312601"},{"$numberLong":"6993364"},{"$numberLong":"6706947"},{"$numberLong":"6735345"},{"$numberLong":"6699499"},{"$numberLong":"6701493"},{"$numberLong":"5584797"},{"$numberLong":"6703916"},{"$numberLong":"6107280"},{"$numberLong":"6089335"},{"$numberLong":"6510325"},{"$numberLong":"6212686"},{"$numberLong":"5706568"},{"$numberLong":"5596308"},{"$numberLong":"5708951"},{"$numberLong":"5594922"},{"$numberLong":"6083167"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Display represents a significant portion of an app's energy consumption. However, developers lack techniques to identify the user interfaces in their apps for which energy needs to be improved. In this paper, we present a technique for detecting display energy hotspots - user interfaces of a mobile app whose energy consumption is greater than optimal. Our technique leverages display power modeling and automated display transformation techniques to detect these hotspots and prioritize them for developers. In an evaluation on a set of popular Android apps, our technique was very accurate in both predicting energy consumption and ranking the display energy hotspots. Our approach was also able to detect display energy hotspots in 398 Android market apps, showing its effectiveness and the pervasiveness of the problem. These results indicate that our approach represents a potentially useful technique for helping developers to detect energy related problems and reduce the energy consumption of their mobile apps.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Color', 'Energy consumption', 'User interfaces', 'Power demand', 'Mobile communication', 'Smart phones', 'Monitoring'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'power aware computing', 'user interfaces'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['display energy hotspots detection', 'user interfaces', 'mobile app', 'energy consumption', 'display power modeling', 'automated display transformation techniques', 'Android market apps']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102585","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":6,"year":2015,"authors":"Mian Wan;Yuchen Jin;Ding Li;William G.

To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative.

In this paper, we investigate how and why quasi-contributors (external developers who did not succeed in getting their contributions accepted to an OSS project) fail. To achieve our goal, we collected data from 21 popular, non-trivial GitHub projects, identified quasi-contributors, and analyzed their pull-requests. In addition, we conducted surveys with quasi-contributors, and projects' integrators, to understand their perceptions about nonacceptance.We found 10,099 quasi-contributors - about 70% of the total actual contributors - that submitted 12,367 non-accepted pull-requests. In five projects, we found more quasi-contributors than actual contributors. About one-third of the developers who took our survey disagreed with the nonacceptance, and around 30% declared the nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request. The main reasons for pull-request nonacceptance from the quasi-contributors' perspective were \"superseded/duplicated pull-request\" and \"mismatch between developer's and team's vision/opinion.\" A manual analysis of a representative sample of 263 pull-requests corroborated with this finding. We also found reasons related to the relationship with the community and lack of experience or commitment from the quasi-contributors. This empirical study is particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers' participation and retention in OSS communities.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Open source software', 'Computer languages', 'Software engineering', 'Face', 'Analytical models', 'Encoding'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['project management', 'public domain software', 'software management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['OSS project', 'open-source software projects', 'manual analysis', 'quasicontributors', 'GitHub projects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['pull-requests', 'quasi contributors', 'newcomers', 'open source software']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453084","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Igor Steinmacher;Gustavo Pinto;Igor Scaliante Wiese;Marco Aurélio Gerosa","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8797633"},{"$numberLong":"8802111"},{"$numberLong":"8811892"},{"$numberLong":"8816766"},{"$numberLong":"8823598"},{"$numberLong":"8935866"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453116","title":"How Modern News Aggregators Help Development Communities Shape and Share Knowledge","abstract":"Many developers rely on modern news aggregator sites such as reddit and hn to stay up to date with the latest technological developments and trends.

To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS, and HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be generated, without blocking any correct patches.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Search problems', 'Software', 'Computer crashes', 'Null value', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['automatic programming', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying patch correctness', 'test-based program repair', 'automatic program repair', 'incorrect patches', 'generated patches', 'behavior similarity', 'test case executions', 'passing tests', 'original programs', 'patched programs', 'similar runtime behavior', 'correct patches', 'program repair systems', 'jGenProg'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Test based program repair', 'patch correctness', 'patch classification', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453152","citationCount":10,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Yingfei Xiong;Xinyuan Liu;Muhan Zeng;Lu Zhang;Gang Huang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China;Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8812054"},{"$numberLong":"8805696"},{"$numberLong":"8812101"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8918958"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Although benchmark sets are used widely throughout computer science, existing benchmarks are not easily adapted to the problem of automatic defect repair, which has several special requirements. Most important of these is the need for benchmark programs with reproducible, important defects and a deterministic method for assessing if those defects have been repaired. This article details the need for a new set of benchmarks, outlines requirements, and then presents two datasets, ManyBugs and IntroClass, consisting between them of 1,183 defects in 15 C programs. Each dataset is designed to support the comparative evaluation of automatic repair algorithms asking a variety of experimental questions. The datasets have empirically defined guarantees of reproducibility and benchmark quality, and each study object is categorized to facilitate qualitative evaluation and comparisons by category of bug or program. The article presents baseline experimental results on both datasets for three existing repair methods, GenProg, AE, and TrpAutoRepair, to reduce the burden on researchers who adopt these datasets for their own comparative evaluations.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Benchmark testing', 'Computer bugs', 'Software systems', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['benchmark testing', 'C language', 'program debugging', 'software maintenance', 'software performance evaluation', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['TrpAutoRepair', 'GenProg', 'qualitative evaluation', 'benchmark quality', 'reproducibility', 'automatic repair algorithms', 'defects assessment', 'deterministic method', 'benchmark programs', 'automatic defect repair', 'computer science', 'benchmark sets', 'benchmark problems', 'automated software repair', 'C programs', 'IntroClass benchmarks', 'ManyBugs benchmarks'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated program repair', 'benchmark', 'subject defect', 'reproducibility', 'ManyBugs', 'IntroClass']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7153570","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":10,"year":2015,"authors":"Claire Le Goues;Neal Holtschulte;Edward K.

To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first largescale study of software engineers' working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours. We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the level of individuals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Companies', 'Software', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering', 'Productivity', 'Rhythm', 'Stress'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['health care', 'occupational health', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['abnormal working hours', 'work health', 'work patterns', 'software engineers', 'work products', 'open source software projects', 'overload detection', 'time stamps', 'stress detection', 'Firefox'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software repository mining', 'overtime', 'overwork', 'open source', 'apache', 'mozilla', 'weekend', 'night']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453143","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Maëlick Claes;Mika V.

Past work focused on automated test generation to detect crashes in Android apps. However, automated repair of crashes has not been studied. In this paper, we propose the first approach to automatically repair Android apps, specifically we propose a technique for fixing crashes in Android apps. Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions). These results confirm our intuition that our proposed transformations form a sufficient set of operators to patch crashes in Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer crashes', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Mobile applications', 'Transistors', 'Testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Android apps', 'test-based repair approaches', 'benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated repair', 'Android apps', 'Crash', 'SBSE']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453078","citationCount":7,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shin Hwei Tan;Zhen Dong;Xiang Gao;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":"Southern Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Shenzhen, China;Nat.

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

The historical defect data in software repositories may contain noises because automatic defect collection is based on modified logs and defect reports. When the previous defect labels of modules are limited, predicting the defect-prone modules becomes a challenging problem. In this study, the authors propose a graph-based semi-supervised defect prediction approach to solve the problems of insufficient labelled data and noisy data. Graph-based semi-supervised learning methods used the labelled and unlabelled data simultaneously and consider them as the nodes of the graph at the training phase. Therefore, they solve the problem of insufficient labelled samples. To improve the stability of noisy defect data, a powerful clustering method, low-rank representation (LRR), and neighbourhood distance are used to construct the relationship graph of samples. Therefore, they propose a new semi-supervised defect prediction approach, named low-rank representation-based semi-supervised software defect prediction (LRRSSDP). The widely used datasets from NASA projects and noisy datasets are employed as test data to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that (i) LRRSSDP outperforms several representative state-of-the-art semi-supervised defect prediction methods; and (ii) LRRSSDP can maintain robustness in noisy environments.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['graph theory', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'pattern clustering', 'program diagnostics', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['semisupervised software defect prediction', 'software engineering', 'historical defect data', 'software repositories', 'automatic defect collection', 'defect reports', 'defect-prone modules', 'semisupervised defect prediction approach', 'insufficient labelled data', 'noisy data', 'unlabelled data', 'insufficient labelled samples', 'noisy defect data', 'low-rank representation', 'LRRSSDP']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8572615","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":15,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhi-Wu Zhang;Xiao-Yuan Jing;Fei Wu","affiliations":"School of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China;State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan University, People's Republic of China;School of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, People's Republic of China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b6b04a430c4a667689"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8946058"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"7530877"},{"$numberLong":"4359365"},{"$numberLong":"4100780"},{"$numberLong":"7181433"},{"$numberLong":"1357896"},{"$numberLong":"1374211"},{"$numberLong":"5645567"},{"$numberLong":"6606585"},{"$numberLong":"7118181"},{"$numberLong":"6909883"},{"$numberLong":"6126422"},{"$numberLong":"7091958"},{"$numberLong":"7175026"},{"$numberLong":"6464273"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Task analysis', 'Feature extraction', 'Filtering', 'Hafnium', 'Software engineering', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'query processing', 'security of data', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['detecting attacks', 'open-source software repositories', 'unreproducible binaries', 'problematic files', 'query augmentation component', 'build logs', 'heuristic rule-based filtering component', 'search scope', 'weighted file ranking module', 'ranked list', 'topmost ranked file', 'automated localization', 'unreproducible builds', 'pre-defined build environments', 'quality assurance', 'Bitcoin', 'Guix', 'RepLoc features', 'unreproducible Debian packages'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Unreproducible Build', 'Localization', 'Software Maintenance']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453064","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhilei Ren;He Jiang;Jifeng Xuan;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Key Lab. for Ubiquitous Network \u0026 Service Software of Liaoning Province, Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian, China;Sch. of Comput.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

However, misusing them can cost developers time and effort, as well as introduce security vulnerabilities in software. We conducted an empirical study on StackOverflow posts, aiming to understand developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and insecure coding practices. We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security - a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverflow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and documentation, as well as the huge gap between security theory and coding practices.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Java', 'Cryptography', 'Encoding', 'Libraries', 'Programming', 'Authentication'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'authorisation', 'computer crime', 'cryptography', 'Java', 'XML'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['secure coding practices', 'Java platform', 'third-party libraries', 'developers time', 'empirical study', 'StackOverflow posts', 'Java secure coding', 'programming obstacles', 'insecure coding practices', 'authorization features', 'third-party framework', 'programming challenges', 'complicated cross-language data handling', 'complex Java-based', 'XML-based approaches', 'cross-site request forgery attacks', 'Spring security', 'cryptography API', 'SSL-TLS security', 'secure coding assistance', 'StackOverflow forum', 'multiple security vulnerabilities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Secure coding', 'Spring security', 'CSRF', 'SSL/TLS', 'certificate validation', 'cryptographic hash functions', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'StackOverflow', 'cryptography']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453095","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Na Meng;Stefan Nagy;Danfeng Yao;Wenjie Zhuang;Gustavo Arango-Argoty","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

We observe that this data has several characteristics, common across IDEs: 1) exponentially distributed - some events or commands dominate the trace (e.g., cursor movement commands), while most other commands occur relatively infrequently; 2) noisy - the traces include spurious commands (or clicks), or unrelated events, that may not be important to the behavior of interest; 3) comprise of overlapping events and commands - specific commands can be invoked by separate mechanisms, and similar events can be triggered by different sources. These characteristics of this data are analogous to the characteristics of synonymy and polysemy in natural language corpora. Therefore, this paper (and presentation) presents a new modeling approach for this type of data, leveraging topic models typically applied to streams of natural language text.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'recommender systems', 'software engineering', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['modeling approach', 'leveraging topic models', 'IDE', 'interaction data', 'key presses', 'recommendation systems', 'software engineering', 'spurious commands', 'unrelated events', 'future developer behavior prediction', 'developers daily clicks', 'cursor movement commands', 'overlapping events', 'overlapping commands', 'synonymy', 'polysemy', 'natural language corpora', 'natural language text'], 'Author Keywords ': ['command recommendation systems', 'IDE interaction data']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453171","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kostadin Damevski;Hui Chen;David C.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance.

We aim to gain a deep understanding of the needs of API producers and consumers alike regarding deprecation. To that end, we investigate why API producers deprecate features, whether they remove deprecated features, how they expect consumers to react, and what prompts an API consumer to react to deprecation. To achieve this goal we conduct semi-structured interviews with 17 third-party Java API producers and survey 170 Java developers. We observe that the current deprecation mechanism in Java and the proposal to enhance it does not address all the needs of a developer. This leads us to propose and evaluate three further enhancements to the deprecation mechanism.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Java', 'Interviews', 'Industries', 'Companies', 'Proposals', 'Guidelines', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'Java', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['Java developers', 'current deprecation mechanism', 'third-party Java API producers', 'API consumer', 'language feature'], 'Author Keywords ': ['API', 'deprecation', 'Java']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453124","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Anand Ashok Sawant;Mauricio Aniche;Arie van Deursen;Alberto Bacchelli","affiliations":"Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8804447"},{"$numberLong":"8816809"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8115612","title":"Software engineering without borders","abstract":"DevOps approaches software engineering by advocating the removal of borders between development and operations.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

In the industry, different fields' engineers have much discussion, since they need to cover the broad knowledge for building one IoT system. The engineers need to have multidisciplinary abilities to collaborate in different fields. For learning such abilities, we should provide opportunities for students from different fields to work collaboratively. For the last 15 years, we have been organizing an education of a robot contest for learning IoT. One goal of this contest is to educate on multidisciplinary abilities. However, the contribution of this program has not been clarified. In a recent work, we briefly introduced an assessment map of multidisciplinary abilities based on the experiences acquired through the education. The map consists of (1) integration ability, (2) performing ability, and (3) cross-understanding ability. The novelty of this work is the evaluation of the education curriculum gained from the contests and its introductory seminars via the assessment map. This paper illustrates the map and evaluates the introductory seminar of the contest.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Education', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Springs', 'Urban areas', 'Robots', 'Embedded systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer aided instruction', 'computer science education', 'educational courses', 'embedded systems', 'Internet of Things'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['assessment map', 'multidisciplinary abilities', 'IoT system development education', 'robot contest', 'embedded software development', 'learning IoT', 'cross-understanding ability', 'education curriculum', 'Internet of Things system'], 'Author Keywords ': ['IoT', 'Robot contest', 'embedded system', 'education program']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8615388","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":18,"year":2018,"authors":"Harumi Watanabe;Mikiko Sato;Masafumi Miwa;Makoto Imamura;Shintaro Hosoai;Nobuhiko Ogura;Hiroyuki Nakamura;Kenji Hisazumi","affiliations":"Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan;Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Change Vision, Inc., Fukui, Japan;Tokyo City University, Tokyo, Japan;Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan;Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1303b04a430c4a667b9d"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7964328"},{"$numberLong":"7976355"},{"$numberLong":"8024173"},{"$numberLong":"7582486"},{"$numberLong":"1598048"},{"$numberLong":"8103068"},{"$numberLong":"6316106"},{"$numberLong":"6341861"},{"$numberLong":"6375774"},{"$numberLong":"6363493"},{"$numberLong":"6875949"},{"$numberLong":"6335453"},{"$numberLong":"6895312"},{"$numberLong":"6317207"},{"$numberLong":"5350404"},{"$numberLong":"7422092"},{"$numberLong":"7202987"},{"$numberLong":"6363494"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Greedy algorithms', 'Cost accounting', 'Sun', 'Model checking', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Systematics'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['greedy algorithms', 'Markov processes', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['concrete execution', 'random testing', 'test case generation', 'symbolic execution', 'program path', 'heuristics-based strategies', 'optimal concolic testing strategy', 'optimal strategy', 'optimal concolic testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Concolic Testing', 'Markov Chain', 'Test Case Generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453088","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xinyu Wang;Jun Sun;Zhenbang Chen;Peixin Zhang;Jingyi Wang;Yun Lin","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8811950"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

When presented with a pair of fingerprint images, the algorithm outputs an estimate of the probability that the two images originate from the same finger. In one experiment, the neural network is trained using a few hundred pairs of images and its performance is subsequently tested using several thousand pairs of images originated from a subset of the database corresponding to 20 individuals. The error rate currently achieved is less than 0.5%.

However, writing and maintaining high-quality test code is challenging and frequently considered of secondary importance. For production code, many open source and industrial software projects employ code review, a well-established software quality practice, but the question remains whether and how code review is also used for ensuring the quality of test code. The aim of this research is to answer this question and to increase our understanding of what developers think and do when it comes to reviewing test code. We conducted both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze more than 300,000 code reviews, and interviewed 12 developers about how they review test files. This work resulted in an overview of current code reviewing practices, a set of identified obstacles limiting the review of test code, and a set of issues that developers would like to see improved in code review tools. The study reveals that reviewing test files is very different from reviewing production files, and that the navigation within the review itself is one of the main issues developers currently face. Based on our findings, we propose a series of recommendations and suggestions for the design of tools and future research.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Production', 'Computer bugs', 'Testing', 'Tools', 'Software quality', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program testing', 'software quality'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['developer review tests', 'code review tools', 'current code reviewing practices', 'review test files', 'software quality practice', 'production code', 'high-quality test code', 'automated testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'automated testing', 'code review', 'Gerrit']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453136","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Davide Spadini;Maurício Aniche;Margaret-Anne Storey;Magiel Bruntink;Alberto Bacchelli","affiliations":"Software Improvement Group, Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Software Improvement Group, Amsterdam, Netherlands;Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8667996"},{"$numberLong":"8811911"},{"$numberLong":"8918999"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453116","title":"How Modern News Aggregators Help Development Communities Shape and Share Knowledge","abstract":"Many developers rely on modern news aggregator sites such as reddit and hn to stay up to date with the latest technological developments and trends.

Despite the effort devoted by the research community in studying code smells, the extent to which code smells in software systems affect software maintainability remains still unclear. In this paper we present a large scale empirical investigation on the diffuseness of code smells and their impact on code change- and fault-proneness. The study was conducted across a total of 395 releases of 30 open source projects and considering 17,350 manually validated instances of 13 different code smell types. The results show that smells characterized by long and/or complex code (e.g., Complex Class) are highly diffused, and that smelly classes have a higher change- and fault-proneness than smell-free classes.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'History', 'Detectors', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Software systems', 'Correlation'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['public domain software', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software maintainability', 'code fault-proneness', 'code change-proneness', 'open source projects', 'code comprehensibility', 'scale empirical investigation', 'code smells', 'smell-free classes', 'complex code'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code smells', 'empirical studies', 'mining software repositories']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453110","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Fabio Palomba;Gabriele Bavota;Massimiliano Di Penta;Fausto Fasano;Rocco Oliveto;Andrea De Lucia","affiliations":"Univ. of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;Univ. della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy;Univ. of Salerno, Salerno, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

Such decisions are taken with varying degrees of expertise in security. In some organisations - particularly those with resources - these are the preserve of computer (or information) security teams. In others - typically smaller organisations - the computing services team may be charged with the responsibility. Often managers have a role to play as guardians of business targets and goals. Be it common workplace practices or strategic decision making, security decisions underpin not only the initial security requirements and their prioritisation but also the adaptation and evolution of these requirements as new business or security contexts arise. However, little is currently understood about how these various demographics approach cyber security decisions and the strategies and approaches that underpin those decisions. What are the typical decision patterns, if any, the consequences of such patterns and their impact (positive or negative) on the security of the system in question? Nor is there any substantial understanding of how the strategies and decision patterns of these different groups contrast. Is security expertise necessarily an advantage when making security decisions in a given context? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the \"how\" and \"why\" behind security decision processes. The Game: In this talk [1], we present a tabletop game - Decisions and Disruptions (D-D) [2] - as a means to investigate these very questions. The game tasks a group of players with managing the security of a small utility company while facing a variety of threats. The game provides a requirements sandbox in which players can experiment with threats, learn about decision making and its consequences, and reflect on their own perception of risk. The game is intentionally kept short - 2 hours - and simple enough to be played without prior training. A cyber-physical infrastructure, depicted through a Lego(R) board, makes the game easy to understand and accessible to players from varying backgrounds and security expertise, without being too trivial a setting for security experts. Key insights: We played D-D with 43 players divided into homogeneous groups (group sizes of 2-6 players): 4 groups of security experts, 4 groups of non-technical managers and 4 groups of general computer scientists. Such observations should, of course, not be generalised, however, the substantial sample size enables in-depth qualitative analysis. Our analysis reveals a number of novel insights regarding security decisions of our three demographics: - Strategies: Security experts had a strong interest in advanced technological solutions and tended to neglect intelligence gathering, to their own detriment: some security expert teams achieved poor results in the game. Managers, too, were technology-driven and focused on data protection while neglecting human factors more than other groups. Computer scientists tended to balance human factors and intelligence gathering with technical solutions, and achieved the best results of the three demographics. - Decision Processes: Technical experience significantly changes the way players think. Teams with little technical experience had shallow, intuition-driven discussions with few concrete arguments. Technical teams, and the most experienced in particular, had much richer debates, driven by concrete scenarios, anecdotes from experience, and procedural thinking. Security experts showed a high confidence in their decisions - despite some of them having bad consequences - while the other groups tended to doubt their own skills - even when they were playing good games. - Patterns: A number of characteristic plays could be identified, some good (balance between priorities, open-mindedness, and adapting strategies based on inputs that challenge one's pre-conceptions), some bad (excessive focus on particular issues, confidence in charismatic leaders), some ugly (\"tunnel vision\" syndrome by over-confident players). These patterns are documented and discussed in the full paper - showing the virtue of the positive ones, discouraging the negative ones, and inviting the readers to do their own introspection. Conclusion: D-D complements existing work on gamification as a means to improve security awareness, education, and training. Beyond the analysis of the security decisions of the three demographics, there is a definite educational and awareness-raising aspect to D-D (as noted consistently by players in all our subject groups). Game boxes will be brought to the conference for demonstration purposes, and the audience will be invited to experiment with D-D themselves, make their own decisions, and reflect on their own perception of security.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Games', 'Cyber-physical systems', 'Computer security', 'Software engineering', 'Privacy', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer games', 'cyber-physical systems', 'decision making', 'game theory', 'human factors', 'organisational aspects', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['decision making', 'tabletop game', 'stakeholders decisions', 'organisations', 'computer security teams', 'demographics approach', 'decisions and disruptions', 'D-D', 'sandbox requirements', 'qualitative analysis', 'human factors', 'gamification', 'security expert teams', 'players', 'cyber security decisions', 'cyber-physical systems game'], 'Author Keywords ': ['security decisions', 'security requirements', 'game', 'decision patterns']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453113","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Sylvain Frey;Awais Rashid;Pauline Anthonysamy;Maria Pinto-Albuquerque;Syad Asad Naqvi","affiliations":"Univ. of Southampton, Southampton, UK;Univ. of Bristol, Bristol, UK;Google, Switzerland;Inst.

Software developers may evolve UML models using merge relationships. However, given the growing heterogeneity of merge strategies and the UML limitations for expressing merge relationship, it is particularly challenging for them to specify merge relationships. Consequently, developers, end up expressing improperly merge relationships. Today, the UML can neither specify the semantics nor the order in which merge relationships must be performed. Developers are unable to specify the semantics and order in which merge relationships must be performed. This study, therefore, proposes UML2Merge, which is a UML extension for expressing merge relationship. The UML2Merge was evaluated through an empirical study with 10 participants for investigating its effects on the merge effort, the correctness of merge relationships, and the participant's acceptance. The collected data suggest that the UML2Merge is proper to express merge relationships by requiring a low merge effort, producing elevated correctness of merge relationships, and having a high acceptance of the participants. The results are encouraging and show the potential for using UML2Merge to express the evolution of UML models through merge relationships.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['software engineering', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['merge relationships', 'software developers', 'UML models', 'Unified Modelling Language models', 'model merging', 'UML extension', 'UML2Merge']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918147","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":5,"year":2019,"authors":"Kleinner Farias;Toacy Cavalcante de Oliveira;Lucian José Gonçales;Vinicius Bischoff","affiliations":"University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil;Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil;University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA), São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1306b04a430c4a667be2"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7965444"},{"$numberLong":"8241333"},{"$numberLong":"7930205"},{"$numberLong":"1000449"},{"$numberLong":"8324972"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

If security defects (i.e., vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement. The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities. We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome). Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution. We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Random access memory', 'Software engineering', 'Software measurement', 'Open source software', 'Security', 'Drives'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'quality assurance', 'security of data', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software development projects', 'orthogonal defect classification', 'ODC', 'vulnerability detection', 'security-specific software development process', 'Firefox', 'phpMyAdmin', 'Chrome', 'open source software projects', 'defect discovery', 'nonsecurity defects', 'security defects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['metrics', 'security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453115","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Patrick Morrison;Rahul Pandita;Xusheng Xiao;Ram Chillarege;Laurie Williams","affiliations":"North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA;Phase Change Software, Golden, CO, USA;Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA;Chillarege Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA;North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

This popularity coupled with user data collection by Android apps has made privacy protection a well-known challenge in the Android ecosystem. In practice, app producers provide privacy policies disclosing what information is collected and processed by the app. However, it is difficult to trace such claims to the corresponding app code to verify whether the implementation is consistent with the policy. Existing approaches for privacy policy alignment focus on information directly accessed through the Android platform (e.g., location and device ID), but are unable to handle user input, a major source of private information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically detects privacy leaks of user-entered data for a given Android app and determines whether such leakage may violate the app's privacy policy claims. For evaluation, we applied our approach to 120 popular apps from three privacy-relevant app categories: finance, health, and dating. The results show that our approach was able to detect 21 strong violations and 18 weak violations from the studied apps.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Ontologies', 'Privacy', 'Data privacy', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Layout'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data privacy', 'mobile computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['privacy protection', 'Android ecosystem', 'app producers', 'privacy policies', 'private information', 'privacy-relevant app categories', 'privacy policy claims', 'android applications', 'Android mobile platform', 'user data collection', 'Android apps', 'app code', 'privacy leaks detection', 'privacy policy alignment'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mobile privacy policy', 'Android application', 'User input']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453060","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaoyin Wang;Xue Qin;Mitra Bokaei Hosseini;Rocky Slavin;Travis D.

A common repair approach is to iteratively first generate candidate programs with possible bug fixes and then validate them against the given tests until a candidate that passes all the tests is found. While this approach is conceptually simple, due to the potentially high number of candidates that need to first be generated and then be compiled and tested, existing repair techniques that embody this approach have relatively low effectiveness, especially for faults at a fine granularity. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a novel repair technique, SketchFix, which generates candidate fixes on demand (as needed) during the test execution. Instead of iteratively re-compiling and re-executing each actual candidate program, SketchFix translates faulty programs to sketches, i.e., partial programs with \"holes\", and compiles each sketch once which may represent thousands of concrete candidates. With the insight that the space of candidates can be reduced substantially by utilizing the runtime behaviors of the tests, SketchFix lazily initializes the candidates of the sketches while validating them against the test execution. We experimentally evaluate SketchFix on the Defects4J benchmark and the experimental results show that SketchFix works particularly well in repairing bugs with expression manipulation at the AST node-level granularity compared to other program repair techniques. Specifically, SketchFix correctly fixes 19 out of 357 defects in 23 minutes on average using the default setting. In addition, SketchFix finds the first repair with 1.6% of re-compilations (#compiled sketches/#candidates) and 3.0% of re-executions out of all repair candidates.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Computer bugs', 'Runtime', 'Syntactics', 'Debugging', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['effective program repair techniques', 'faulty programs', 'manual debugging', 'common repair approach', 'candidate programs', 'possible bug fixes', 'relatively low effectiveness', 'novel repair technique', 'SketchFix', 'candidate fixes', 'test execution', 'iteratively re-compiling', 're-executing each actual candidate program', 'partial programs', 'concrete candidates', 're-compilations', 'repair candidates', 'practical program repair', 'on-demand candidate generation', '#compiled sketches-#candidates'], 'Author Keywords ': ['debugging', 'program repair', 'program synthesis', 'lazy initialization', 'execution driven pruning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453056","citationCount":14,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jinru Hua;Mengshi Zhang;Kaiyuan Wang;Sarfraz Khurshid","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8665493"},{"$numberLong":"8665475"},{"$numberLong":"8667970"},{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8802763"},{"$numberLong":"8802695"},{"$numberLong":"8812056"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952344"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem.

How to detect and keep the malapps out of the app markets is an ongoing challenge. One of the central design points of Android security mechanism is permission control that restricts the access of apps to core facilities of devices. However, it imparts a significant responsibility to the app developers with regard to accurately specifying the requested permissions and to the users with regard to fully understanding the risk of granting certain combinations of permissions. Android permissions requested by an app depict the app's behavioral patterns. In order to help understanding Android permissions, in this paper, we explore the permission-induced risk in Android apps on three levels in a systematic manner. First, we thoroughly analyze the risk of an individual permission and the risk of a group of collaborative permissions. We employ three feature ranking methods, namely, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and T-test to rank Android individual permissions with respect to their risk. We then use sequential forward selection as well as principal component analysis to identify risky permission subsets. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of risky permissions for malapp detection with support vector machine, decision trees, as well as random forest. Third, we in depth analyze the detection results and discuss the feasibility as well as the limitations of malapp detection based on permission requests. We evaluate our methods on a very large official app set consisting of 310 926 benign apps and 4868 real-world malapps and on a third-party app sets. The empirical results show that our malapp detectors built on risky permissions give satisfied performance (a detection rate as 94.62% with a false positive rate as 0.6%), catch the malapps' essential patterns on violating permission access regulations, and are universally applicable to unknown malapps (detection rate as 74.03%).","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Principal component analysis', 'Smart phones', 'Security', 'Correlation', 'Support vector machines'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'invasive software', 'principal component analysis', 'smart phones'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['permission-induced risk', 'malicious applications', 'Android security mechanism', 'permission control', 'collaborative permissions', 'mutual information', 'correlation coefficient', 'T-test', 'sequential forward selection', 'principal component analysis', 'malapp detection', 'support vector machine', 'decision trees', 'random forest', 'third-party app sets']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891250","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":2,"year":2014,"authors":"Wei Wang;Xing Wang;Dawei Feng;Jiqiang Liu;Zhen Han;Xiangliang Zhang","affiliations":"School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c0b04a430c4a6677cb"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7945694"},{"$numberLong":"8217782"},{"$numberLong":"7411297"},{"$numberLong":"7346711"},{"$numberLong":"8104380"},{"$numberLong":"7986500"},{"$numberLong":"7888730"},{"$numberLong":"7489879"},{"$numberLong":"7846747"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"8067440"},{"$numberLong":"7583740"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7847010"},{"$numberLong":"7878263"},{"$numberLong":"8322752"},{"$numberLong":"8315029"},{"$numberLong":"7724765"},{"$numberLong":"8374030"},{"$numberLong":"8357771"},{"$numberLong":"8388984"},{"$numberLong":"8255798"},{"$numberLong":"8506545"},{"$numberLong":"8530576"},{"$numberLong":"8542215"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8567542"},{"$numberLong":"8597321"},{"$numberLong":"8245867"},{"$numberLong":"8661441"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6735264"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Existing APR techniques can be generally divided into two families: semantics-vs. heuristics-based. Semantics-based APR uses symbolic execution and test suites to extract semantic constraints, and uses program synthesis to synthesize repairs that satisfy the extracted constraints. Heuristic-based APR generates large populations of repair candidates via source manipulation, and searches for the best among them. Both families largely rely on a primary assumption that a program is correctly patched if the generated patch leads the program to pass all provided test cases. Patch correctness is thus an especially pressing concern. A repair technique may generate overfitting patches, which lead a program to pass all existing test cases, but fails to generalize beyond them. In this work, we revisit the overfitting problem with a focus on semantics-based APR techniques, complementing previous studies of the overfitting problem in heuristics-based APR. We perform our study using IntroClass and Codeflaws benchmarks, two datasets well-suited for assessing repair quality, to systematically characterize and understand the nature of overfitting in semantics-based APR. We find that similar to heuristics-based APR, overfitting also occurs in semantics-based APR in various different ways.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Semantics', 'Benchmark testing', 'Software engineering', 'Tools', 'Engines', 'Sociology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['symbolic execution', 'test suites', 'program synthesis', 'overfitting patches', 'semantics-based APR techniques', 'semantics-based Automated Program Repair', 'buggy software', 'patch correctness', 'IntroClass', 'repair quality assessment', 'Codeflaws'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Automated Program Repair', 'Program Synthesis', 'Symbolic Execution', 'Patch Overfitting']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453074","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xuan-Bach D.

We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

This vocabulary mismatch problem can make code search inefficient. In this paper, we present Code voCaBulary (CoCaBu), an approach to resolving the vocabulary mismatch problem when dealing with free-form code search queries. Our approach leverages common developer questions and the associated expert answers to augment user queries with the relevant, but missing, structural code entities in order to improve the performance of matching relevant code examples within large code repositories. To instantiate this approach, we build GitSearch, a code search engine, on top of GitHub and Stack Overflow Q\u0026A data. We evaluate GitSearch in several dimensions to demonstrate that (1) its code search results are correct with respect to user-accepted answers; (2) the results are qualitatively better than those of existing Internet-scale code search engines; (3) our engine is competitive against web search engines, such as Google, in helping users solve programming tasks; and (4) GitSearch provides code examples that are acceptable or interesting to the community as answers for Stack Overflow questions.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Search engines', 'Software engineering', 'Vocabulary', 'Indexes', 'Programming', 'Engines', 'Natural languages'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Internet', 'query processing', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'search engines'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['structuring user queries', 'source code terms', 'search query', 'vocabulary mismatch problem', 'free-form code search queries', 'structural code entities', 'code repositories', 'GitSearch', 'user-accepted answers', 'web search engines', 'Internet-scale code search engines', 'expert answers', 'code vocabulary', 'CoCaBu', 'developer questions', 'stack overflow Q and A data', 'Google', 'programming tasks', 'user queries augmentation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code search', 'GitHub', 'Free form search', 'Query augmentation', 'StackOverflow', 'Vocabulary mismatch']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453173","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Raphael Sirres;Tegawendé F.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

Why Licensing Bugs Matter","abstract":"Software licenses dictate how source code or binaries can be modified, reused, and redistributed. In the case of open source projects, software licenses generally fit into two main categories, permissive and restrictive, depending on the degree to which they allow redistribution or modification under licenses different from the original one(s). Developers and organizations can also modify existing licenses, creating custom licenses with specific permissive/restrictive terms. Having such a variety of software licenses can create confusion among software developers, and can easily result in the introduction of licensing bugs, not necessarily limited to well-known license incompatibilities. In this work, we report a study aimed at characterizing licensing bugs by (i) building a catalog categorizing the types of licensing bugs developers and other stakeholders face, and (ii) understanding the implications licensing bugs have on the software projects they affect. The presented study is the result of the manual analysis of 1,200 discussions related to licensing bugs carried out in issue trackers and in five legal mailing lists of open source communities. Our findings uncover new types of licensing bugs not addressed in prior literature, and a detailed assessment of their implications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Licenses', 'Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Law', 'Guidelines', 'Stakeholders'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'project management', 'public domain software', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software projects', 'software licenses', 'custom licenses', 'software developers', 'license incompatibilities', 'licensing bug developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software Licenses', 'Empirical Studies', 'Open Source Practices']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453086","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Vendome;Daniel German;Massimiliano Di Penta;Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA;Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada;Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Univ. della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland;Univ. de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia;Coll. of William \u0026 Mary Williamsburg, Williamsburg, VA, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8930891"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"6945855","title":"The Impact of API Change- and Fault-Proneness on the User Ratings of Android Apps","abstract":"The mobile apps market is one of the fastest growing areas in the information technology. In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Software', 'History', 'Computer bugs', 'Educational institutions', 'Electronic mail'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'software fault tolerance', 'system recovery'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API change-proneness', 'API fault-proneness', 'user ratings', 'Android Apps', 'mobile Apps market', 'information technology', 'software repository mining'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Mining software repositories', 'empirical studies', 'android', 'API changes']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945855","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":17,"year":2015,"authors":"Gabriele Bavota;Mario Linares-Vásquez;Carlos Eduardo Bernal-Cárdenas;Massimiliano Di Penta;Rocco Oliveto;Denys Poshyvanyk","affiliations":"Department of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA;Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Department of Bioscience and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy;Department of Computer Science, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7372063"},{"$numberLong":"8080001"},{"$numberLong":"7181434"},{"$numberLong":"7503721"},{"$numberLong":"7503724"},{"$numberLong":"7965405"},{"$numberLong":"7332474"},{"$numberLong":"7332475"},{"$numberLong":"7332476"},{"$numberLong":"7816486"},{"$numberLong":"7816485"},{"$numberLong":"7816535"},{"$numberLong":"8094439"},{"$numberLong":"8094467"},{"$numberLong":"7515457"},{"$numberLong":"7972721"},{"$numberLong":"7180072"},{"$numberLong":"7962363"},{"$numberLong":"7476674"},{"$numberLong":"7476768"},{"$numberLong":"7476661"},{"$numberLong":"7476770"},{"$numberLong":"7907524"},{"$numberLong":"7765038"},{"$numberLong":"7832954"},{"$numberLong":"8449438"},{"$numberLong":"8491125"},{"$numberLong":"8539074"},{"$numberLong":"8560133"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1199197"},{"$numberLong":"4222596"},{"$numberLong":"6684534"},{"$numberLong":"6224307"},{"$numberLong":"6112328"},{"$numberLong":"6128277"},{"$numberLong":"6234407"},{"$numberLong":"6224268"},{"$numberLong":"6224271"},{"$numberLong":"6224267"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"5989838"},{"$numberLong":"6227134"},{"$numberLong":"6693127"},{"$numberLong":"1201219"},{"$numberLong":"6233418"},{"$numberLong":"6606629"}]},{"_id":"8453110","title":"[Journal First] On the Diffuseness and the Impact on Maintainability of Code Smells: A Large Scale Empirical Investigation","abstract":"Code smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may hinder code comprehensibility and maintainability.

Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cloning', 'Search engines', 'Semantics', 'Software', 'Natural languages', 'Syntactics', 'Runtime'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['query processing', 'search engines', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code-to-code search engine', 'code search tasks', 'code-to-code approach', 'code-patch recommendation', 'FaCoY', 'semantic code clones', 'directly matching code query tokens', 'user input code', 'statically finding code fragments', 'code diversity', 'code transplantation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'semantic clones', 'code to code search']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453174","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Kisub Kim;Dongsun Kim;Tegawendé F.

To reason about their correctness and track opportunities for optimisations, sophisticated instrumentation frameworks, such as Valgrind and Pin, have been developed. Both provide only limited facilities for analysing the collected data. This work presents a Valgrind's extension for examining a software applications' dynamic memory profile through live interactive analysis with SQL. The Pico COllections Query Library (pico ql) module maps Valgrind's data structures that contain the instrumented application's memory operations metadata to a relational interface. Queries are type-safe and the module imposes only a trivial overhead when idle. The authors evaluate the proposed approach on ten applications and through a qualitative study.

However, this research has focused mainly on social/cultural factors, ignoring the environment itself - the tools and infrastructure. To shed some light onto how tools and infrastructure might somehow factor into OSS barriers to entry, we conducted a field study with five teams of software professionals, who worked through five use-cases to analyze the tools and infrastructure used in their OSS projects. These software professionals found tool/infrastructure barriers in 7% to 71% of the use-case steps that they analyzed, most of which are tied to newcomer barriers that have been established in the literature. Further, over 80% of the barrier types they found include attributes that are biased against women.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Databases', 'Problem-solving', 'Open source software', 'Cultural differences', 'Face'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['cultural aspects', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['sociotechnical perspective', 'OSS barriers', 'software professionals', 'OSS projects', 'newcomer barriers', 'open source barriers', 'open-source software communities', 'social-cultural factors', 'tool-infrastructure barriers', 'use-case steps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['open source software', 'newcomer', 'gender']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453179","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Christopher Mendez;Hema Susmita Padala;Zoe Steine-Hanson;Claudia Hildebrand;Amber Horvath;Charles Hill;Logan Simpson;Nupoor Patil;Anita Sarma;Margaret Burnett","affiliations":"Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA;Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8719419"},{"$numberLong":"8491276"},{"$numberLong":"8797636"},{"$numberLong":"8812044"},{"$numberLong":"8811892"},{"$numberLong":"8812068"},{"$numberLong":"8819552"},{"$numberLong":"8818790"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

A Large Scale Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults","abstract":"Empirical validation of software testing studies is increasingly relying on mutants. This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and De-fects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also found that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we found that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Fault detection', 'Correlation', 'Java', 'Measurement', 'Software testing', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mutation score', 'randomly selected test suites', 'higher mutation scores', 'mutation scores correlated', 'real fault detection', 'scale empirical study', 'empirical validation', 'software testing studies', 'mutant scores', 'test suite size', 'dependent variable the detection', 'fault detection capability'], 'Author Keywords ': ['mutation testing', 'real faults', 'test suite effectiveness']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mike Papadakis;Donghwan Shin;Shin Yoo;Doo-Hwan Bae","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730152"},{"$numberLong":"8735019"},{"$numberLong":"8919245"},{"$numberLong":"8952421"},{"$numberLong":"8705674"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

The crosscutting nature of these development tasks requires developers to maintain complex mental models and forces them (a) to manually split their high-level tasks into low-level commands that are supported by the various tools, and (b) to (re) establish their current context in each tool. In this paper we present Devy, a Conversational Developer Assistant (CDA) that enables developers to focus on their high-level development tasks. Devy reduces the number of manual, often complex, low-level commands that developers need to perform, freeing them to focus on their high-level tasks. Specifically, Devy infers high-level intent from developer's voice commands and combines this with an automatically-generated context model to determine appropriate workflows for invoking low-level tool actions; where needed, Devy can also prompt the developer for additional information. Through a mixed methods evaluation with 21 industrial developers, we found that Devy provided an intuitive interface that was able to support many development tasks while helping developers stay focused within their development environment. While industrial developers were largely supportive of the automation Devy enabled, they also provided insights into several other tasks and workflows CDAs could support to enable them to better focus on the important parts of their development tasks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Task analysis', 'Tools', 'Context', 'Context modeling', 'Software', 'Switches'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['interactive systems', 'software engineering', 'ubiquitous computing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['high-level tasks', 'low-level commands', 'Devy', 'high-level development tasks', 'high-level intent', 'automatically-generated context model', 'low-level tool actions', 'development environment', 'context-aware conversational developer assistants', 'modern software systems'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Conversational Development Assistants', 'Natural User Interfaces']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453178","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Nick Bradley;Thomas Fritz;Reid Holmes","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

Studies indicate that sentiment analysis tools provide unreliable results when used out-of-the-box, since they are not designed to process SE datasets. The silver bullet for a successful application of sentiment analysis tools to SE datasets might be their customization to the specific usage context. We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting crowdsourced opinions mined from Stack Overflow (e.g., what is the sentiment of developers about the usability of a library). To reach our goal, we retrained-on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow-a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative. We changed our focus and performed a thorough investigation of the accuracy of these tools on a variety of SE datasets. Our results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Sentiment analysis', 'Tools', 'Software engineering', 'Software', 'Task analysis', 'Training', 'Motion pictures'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data analysis', 'data mining', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'sentiment analysis', 'social networking (online)', 'software engineering', 'software libraries'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['sentiment analysis tools', 'app reviews evaluation', 'commit messages', 'out-of-the-box', 'silver bullet', 'crowdsourced opinions mined', 'stack overflow', 'deep learning', 'time-consuming training process', 'effort training process', 'research community', 'developers emotions analyzing', 'software engineering tasks', 'SE datasets', 'software library recommender'], 'Author Keywords ': ['sentiment analysis', 'software engineering', 'NLP']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453067","citationCount":11,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Bin Lin;Fiorella Zampetti;Gabriele Bavota;Massimiliano Di Penta;Michele Lanza;Rocco Oliveto","affiliations":"Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Dept. of Eng., Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;Dept. of Eng., Univ. of Sannio, Benevento, Italy;Software Inst., Univ. della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland;STAKE Lab., Univ. of Molise, Pesche, Italy","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8501934"},{"$numberLong":"8685106"},{"$numberLong":"8725481"},{"$numberLong":"8736222"},{"$numberLong":"8805726"},{"$numberLong":"8816816"},{"$numberLong":"8890439"},{"$numberLong":"8919242"},{"$numberLong":"8945613"},{"$numberLong":"8952437"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"7886971","title":"Reference Hijacking: Patching, Protecting and Analyzing on Unmodified and Non-rooted Android Devices","abstract":"Many efforts have been paid to enhance the security of Android. However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Libraries', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Prototypes', 'Malware', 'Access control'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'mobile computing', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reference hijacking technique', 'Android devices', 'Android security', 'reset procedure', 'security-enhanced alternatives', 'Dalvik environment', 'Android Runtime environment', 'PatchMan system', 'ControlMan system', 'TaintMan system', 'security enhancements'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Android', 'Security enhancement', 'Practicability']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886971","citationCount":4,"referenceCount":1,"year":2016,"authors":"Wei You;Bin Liang;Wenchang Shi;Shuyang Zhu;Peng Wang;Sikefu Xie;Xiangyu Zhang","affiliations":"Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Key Lab. of Data Eng. \u0026 Knowledge Eng., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

A great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager. Through statistical analysis we identify how engineers and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering differs from other knowledge work groups.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Software engineering', 'Birds', 'Productivity', 'Organizations', 'Tools', 'Knowledge engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP management', 'project management', 'software development management', 'statistical analysis', 'team working'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['great manager', 'software engineers', 'good team', 'software engineering manager', 'software teams', 'manager attributes', 'software engineering research studies', 'statistical analysis', 'productivity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Manager', 'Software Engineering', 'Knowledge Work', 'Empirical Study', 'Conceptual Framework', 'Manager Attributes', 'Technical Skills']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453140","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Eirini Kalliamvakou;Christian Bird;Thomas Zimmermann;Andrew Begel;Robert DeLine;Daniel M.

Modelling and analyzing requirements models of PLs allows for early detection and correction of requirements errors -- including unintended feature interactions, which are a serious problem in feature-rich systems. A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms. In this paper we develop PL model checking using two leading SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithms: IMC and IC3. We describe the algorithms, prove their correctness, and report on our implementation. Evaluating our methods on three PL models from the literature, we demonstrate an improvement of up to 3 orders of magnitude over the existing BDD-based method.","conference":"IEEE/ACM IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Model checking', 'Interpolation', 'Adaptation models', 'Computational modeling', 'Data structures', 'Boolean functions', 'Analytical models'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['binary decision diagrams', 'computability', 'program verification', 'software product lines', 'systems analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['product-line requirements', 'SAT-based method', 'product line engineering', 'requirement error detection', 'requirement error correction', 'feature interaction', 'product family verification', 'high-level design', 'SMV language', 'NuSMV tool', 'BDD method', 'PL model checking', 'SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithm', 'IMC algorithm', 'IC3 algorithm', 'correctness proving'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Product Lines', 'Symbolic Model Checking', 'IC3', 'IMC']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194573","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2015,"authors":"Shoham Ben-David;Baruch Sterin;Joanne M.

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software systems', 'Task analysis', 'Software design', 'Fats', 'Documentation', 'Companies'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['DP industry', 'software engineering', 'source code (software)', 'system documentation'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['source code', 'grounded theory', 'design documentation', 'design problems identification', 'code elements', 'software companies'], 'Author Keywords ': ['design problem', 'grounded theory', 'software design', 'symptoms']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453170","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Leonardo Sousa;Anderson Oliveira;Willian Oizumi;Simone Barbosa;Alessandro Garcia;Jaejoon Lee;Marcos Kalinowski;Rafael de Mello;Baldoino Fonseca;Roberto Oliveira;Carlos Lucena;Rodrigo Paes","affiliations":";;;;;;;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8813270"},{"$numberLong":"8844411"},{"$numberLong":"8870183"},{"$numberLong":"8987457"},{"$numberLong":"8990240"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Surprisingly, there are very few works that study statistical problems in software engineering (SE). Aim: Assess the existence of statistical errors in SE experiments. Method: Compile the most common statistical errors in experimental disciplines. Survey experiments published in ICSE to assess whether errors occur in high quality SE publications. Results: The same errors as identified in others disciplines were found in ICSE experiments, where 30 of the reviewed papers included several error types such as: a) missing statistical hypotheses, b) missing sample size calculation, c) failure to assess statistical test assumptions, and d) uncorrected multiple testing. This rather large error rate is greater for research papers where experiments are confined to the validation section. The origin of the errors can be traced back to: a) researchers not having sufficient statistical training, and b) a profusion of exploratory research. Conclusions: This paper provides preliminary evidence that SE research suffers from the same statistical problems as other experimental disciplines. However, the SE community appears to be unaware of any shortcomings in its experiments, whereas other disciplines work hard to avoid these threats. Further research is necessary to find the underlying causes and set up corrective measures, but there are some potentially effective actions and are a priori easy to implement: a) improve the statistical training of SE researchers, and b) enforce quality assessment and reporting guidelines in SE publications.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Bibliographies', 'Training', 'Guidelines', 'Error analysis', 'Back'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['psychology', 'research and development', 'software engineering', 'statistical testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software engineering experiments', 'SE experiments', 'high quality SE publications', 'ICSE experiments', 'statistical hypotheses', 'statistical test assumptions', 'SE community', 'SE researchers', 'quality assessment', 'statistical errors', 'statistical training', 'SE research'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Literature review', 'Survey', 'Prevalence', 'Statistical errors']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453201","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rolando P.

Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides: When the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Feature extraction', 'Computer bugs', 'Navigation', 'History', 'Tools', 'Visualization', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['feature extraction', 'information retrieval', 'pattern clustering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['identifying features', 'fork-based development', 'open source communities', 'INFOX', 'nonmerged features', 'clusters cohesive code fragments', 'network-analysis techniques', 'information-retrieval techniques', 'human-subject evaluation'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Fork-based development', 'Github', 'Community detection', 'Information retrieval', 'overview of forks', 'transparency']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453068","citationCount":3,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Shurui Zhou;Stefan Stanciulescu;Olaf Leßenich;Yingfei Xiong;Andrzej Wasowski;Christian Kästner","affiliations":";;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"},{"$numberLong":"8952413"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

In the industry, different fields' engineers have much discussion, since they need to cover the broad knowledge for building one IoT system. The engineers need to have multidisciplinary abilities to collaborate in different fields. For learning such abilities, we should provide opportunities for students from different fields to work collaboratively. For the last 15 years, we have been organizing an education of a robot contest for learning IoT. One goal of this contest is to educate on multidisciplinary abilities. However, the contribution of this program has not been clarified. In a recent work, we briefly introduced an assessment map of multidisciplinary abilities based on the experiences acquired through the education. The map consists of (1) integration ability, (2) performing ability, and (3) cross-understanding ability. The novelty of this work is the evaluation of the education curriculum gained from the contests and its introductory seminars via the assessment map. This paper illustrates the map and evaluates the introductory seminar of the contest.","conference":"IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Education', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Springs', 'Urban areas', 'Robots', 'Embedded systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer aided instruction', 'computer science education', 'educational courses', 'embedded systems', 'Internet of Things'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['assessment map', 'multidisciplinary abilities', 'IoT system development education', 'robot contest', 'embedded software development', 'learning IoT', 'cross-understanding ability', 'education curriculum', 'Internet of Things system'], 'Author Keywords ': ['IoT', 'Robot contest', 'embedded system', 'education program']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8615388","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":18,"year":2018,"authors":"Harumi Watanabe;Mikiko Sato;Masafumi Miwa;Makoto Imamura;Shintaro Hosoai;Nobuhiko Ogura;Hiroyuki Nakamura;Kenji Hisazumi","affiliations":"Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan;Tokai University, Tokyo, Japan;Change Vision, Inc., Fukui, Japan;Tokyo City University, Tokyo, Japan;Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan;Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1303b04a430c4a667b9d"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"7964328"},{"$numberLong":"7976355"},{"$numberLong":"8024173"},{"$numberLong":"7582486"},{"$numberLong":"1598048"},{"$numberLong":"8103068"},{"$numberLong":"6316106"},{"$numberLong":"6341861"},{"$numberLong":"6375774"},{"$numberLong":"6363493"},{"$numberLong":"6875949"},{"$numberLong":"6335453"},{"$numberLong":"6895312"},{"$numberLong":"6317207"},{"$numberLong":"5350404"},{"$numberLong":"7422092"},{"$numberLong":"7202987"},{"$numberLong":"6363494"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, there is no consensus on which type of representation better supports the comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey's cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies performed in two countries with 69 and 83 participants respectively, in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models. Conclusions: Our findings can be explained by Vessey's cognitive fit theory as tabular models implicitly capture elementary linear spatial relationships. Interest for ICSE: It is almost taken for granted in Software Engineering that graphical-, diagram-based models are \"the\" way to go (e.g., the SE Body of Knowledge). This paper provides some experimental-based doubts that this might not always be the case. It will provide an interesting debate that might ripple to traditional requirements and design notations outside security.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Security', 'Task analysis', 'Unified modeling language', 'Software engineering', 'Risk management', 'Data mining', 'Complexity theory'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['risk analysis', 'risk management', 'security of data', 'software engineering', 'solid modelling'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['comprehension questions', \"Vessey's cognitive fit theory\", 'elementary linear spatial relationships', 'diagram-based models', 'security risk assessment', 'graphical representations', 'security controls', 'security risks', 'tabular risk models', 'model comprehension', 'Software Engineering'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical Study', 'Security Risk Assessment', 'Risk Modeling', 'Comprehensibility', 'Cognitive Fit']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453097","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Katsiaryna Labunets;Fabio Massacci;Federica Paci;Sabrina Marczak;Flávio Moreira de Oliveira","affiliations":"Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy;Univ. of Southampton, Southampton, UK;Pontificia Univ.

Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code. The plagiarism detection algorithm based on our new birthmarks is resilient to both weak obfuscation techniques such as compiler optimizations and strong obfuscation techniques implemented in tools such as SandMark, Allatori and Upx. We have developed a tool called DYKIS-PD (DYKIS Plagiarism Detection tool) and conducted extensive experiments on large number of binary programs. The tool, the benchmarks and the experimental results are all publicly available.","conference":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Plagiarism', 'Licenses', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Watermarking'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['fraud', 'program diagnostics', 'security of data'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['DYKIS plagiarism detection tool', 'DYKIS-PD', 'Upx', 'Allatori', 'SandMark', 'compiler optimization', 'code obfuscation', 'source code', 'software birthmark', 'dynamic key instruction sequences', 'software plagiarism detection'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software plagiarism detection', 'software birthmark']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7153572","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":10,"year":2015,"authors":"Zhenzhou Tian;Qinghua Zheng;Ting Liu;Ming Fan;Eryue Zhuang;Zijiang Yang","affiliations":"Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOEKLINNS), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China;Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12b5b04a430c4a667657"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"7496465"},{"$numberLong":"8080048"},{"$numberLong":"7774504"},{"$numberLong":"7887707"},{"$numberLong":"7490384"},{"$numberLong":"8293854"},{"$numberLong":"7883388"},{"$numberLong":"7888597"},{"$numberLong":"8629870"},{"$numberLong":"8812083"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1219058"},{"$numberLong":"6227178"},{"$numberLong":"6328271"},{"$numberLong":"6086533"},{"$numberLong":"1610609"},{"$numberLong":"1019480"},{"$numberLong":"514697"},{"$numberLong":"4023995"},{"$numberLong":"957835"},{"$numberLong":"1698785"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

This is because proper preprocessing of imbalanced data can enable researchers to reduce defects as much as possible, which, in turn, may lead to the elimination of defects in existing data sets. Despite the remarkable achievements that have been accomplished in machine learning studies, systematic literature reviews of imbalanced data preprocessing techniques are lacking. Consequently, there are a limited number of systematic literature review studies on imbalanced data preprocessing. In this study, the authors assess the existing literature to identify the key issues related to data quality and handling and to provide a convenient collection of the techniques used to address these issues when performing data preprocessing. They applied a systematic literature review method involving a manual search to select articles published from January 2010 to September 2018 for review. The qualities of the existing studies were assessed using certain quality assessment criteria. Of the 118 relevant studies found, only 2% were identified as having been conducted following systematic literature review guidelines. This study, therefore, calls for more systematic literature review studies on data preprocessing to improve the quality of the data applied in machine learning studies.","conference":"IET Software","terms":"{'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['learning (artificial intelligence)', 'reviews'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['quality assessment criteria', 'defect reduction', 'imbalanced data preprocessing techniques', 'machine learning', 'data quality', 'data sets', 'systematic literature review guidelines', 'systematic literature review method']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918216","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":59,"year":2019,"authors":"Ebubeogu Amarachukwu Felix;Sai Peck Lee","affiliations":"University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;University of Malaya 50603, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a1306b04a430c4a667be2"}},"citations":[],"references":[{"$numberLong":"6035727"},{"$numberLong":"5978225"},{"$numberLong":"5128907"},{"$numberLong":"7675460"},{"$numberLong":"7027524"},{"$numberLong":"6824804"},{"$numberLong":"7990255"},{"$numberLong":"8097045"},{"$numberLong":"6468038"},{"$numberLong":"7550920"},{"$numberLong":"6606584"},{"$numberLong":"6299324"},{"$numberLong":"5467094"},{"$numberLong":"6747166"},{"$numberLong":"7959597"},{"$numberLong":"977291"},{"$numberLong":"7409958"},{"$numberLong":"391407"},{"$numberLong":"8168387"},{"$numberLong":"6227909"},{"$numberLong":"6035700"},{"$numberLong":"6674958"},{"$numberLong":"7194627"},{"$numberLong":"6976088"},{"$numberLong":"7450669"},{"$numberLong":"7539677"},{"$numberLong":"8058420"},{"$numberLong":"4021972"},{"$numberLong":"1019484"},{"$numberLong":"6909884"},{"$numberLong":"7589046"},{"$numberLong":"6406734"},{"$numberLong":"7395717"},{"$numberLong":"7109937"},{"$numberLong":"6766252"},{"$numberLong":"6816044"},{"$numberLong":"7397461"},{"$numberLong":"7022596"},{"$numberLong":"7378029"},{"$numberLong":"7483438"},{"$numberLong":"7273627"},{"$numberLong":"6761610"},{"$numberLong":"7312601"},{"$numberLong":"6993364"},{"$numberLong":"6706947"},{"$numberLong":"6735345"},{"$numberLong":"6699499"},{"$numberLong":"6701493"},{"$numberLong":"5584797"},{"$numberLong":"6703916"},{"$numberLong":"6107280"},{"$numberLong":"6089335"},{"$numberLong":"6510325"},{"$numberLong":"6212686"},{"$numberLong":"5706568"},{"$numberLong":"5596308"},{"$numberLong":"5708951"},{"$numberLong":"5594922"},{"$numberLong":"6083167"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups' evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups' assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup's evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Companies', 'Interviews', 'Software', 'Biological system modeling', 'Turning', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['organisational aspects', 'software development management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['requirements artefacts', 'engineering practices', 'maturing startups', 'practical insights', 'software startups', 'systematic requirement analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['requirements engineering', 'startups', 'evolution', 'grounded theory']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453156","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Catarina Gralha;Daniela Damian;Anthony Wasserman;Miguel Goulão;João Araújo","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8933680"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Prior works show the feasibility of automated repair, and the research focus is gradually shifting towards the quality of generated patches. One promising direction is to control the quality of generated patches by controlling the quality of test-suites used. In this paper, we investigate the question: \"\"Can traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing be used for automated program repair?\"\". We empirically investigate the effectiveness of test-suite metrics (statement / branch coverage and mutation score) in controlling the reliability of repairs (the likelihood that repairs cause regressions). We conduct the largest-scale experiments to date with real-world software, and perform the first correlation study between test-suite metrics and the reliability of generated repairs. Our results show that by increasing test-suite metrics, the reliability of repairs tend to increase. Particularly, such trend is most strongly observed in statement coverage. This implies that traditional test-suite metrics used in software testing can also be used to improve the reliability of repairs in program repair.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Measurement', 'Correlation', 'Software reliability', 'Software', 'Software testing'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'program testing', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['regressions', 'test-suite metrics', 'automated repair', 'generated repairs', 'correlation study', 'automated program repair', 'software testing', 'test-suites', 'generated patches'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Code Coverage', 'Program Repair', 'Mutation Testing']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453057","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jooyong Yi;Shin Hwei Tan;Sergey Mechtaev;Marcel Böhme;Abhik Roychoudhury","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer science', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Conferences', 'Software measurement', 'Information technology'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['online front-ends', 'reverse engineering', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale field study', 'program comprehension activities', 'measure comprehension time', 'professional developers', 'program comprehension measurement'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Comprehension', 'Field Study', 'Inference Model']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453126","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xin Xia;Lingfeng Bao;David Lo;Zhenchang Xing;Ahmed E.

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Australia', 'Tools', 'Software', 'Computer science', 'Information technology', 'Information systems'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['pattern classification', 'software engineering', 'software tools'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['empirical software engineering', 'Web browsers', 'condition random field based approach', 'low-level actions', 'data collection', 'high-level development activities', 'fine-grained event sequences', 'collected behavior data', 'work settings', 'software tools', 'uninstrumented applications', 'CRF model', 'one-week work', 'professional developers', 'working data', 'ActivitySpace framework', 'meaningful development activities'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Software development', \"Developers' interaction data\", 'Condition Random Field']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453167","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingfeng Bao;Zhenchang Xing;Xin Xia;David Lo;Ahmed E.

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons-missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Data mining', 'Java', 'Software', 'Software reliability', 'Syntactics', 'Libraries'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['application program interfaces', 'data mining', 'Java', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'program diagnostics', 'public domain software', 'question answering (information retrieval)', 'Web sites'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['API misuse', 'API usage mining framework', 'potential API usage violations', 'API calls', 'alternative API usage details', 'Stack Overflow posts'], 'Author Keywords ': ['online Q\u0026A forums', 'API usage pattern', 'code example assessment']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453166","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Tianyi Zhang;Ganesha Upadhyaya;Anastasia Reinhardt;Hridesh Rajan;Miryung Kim","affiliations":";;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8754426"},{"$numberLong":"8812028"},{"$numberLong":"8812042"},{"$numberLong":"8812114"},{"$numberLong":"8816735"},{"$numberLong":"8816757"},{"$numberLong":"8816758"},{"$numberLong":"8913924"},{"$numberLong":"8952239"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453131","title":"Collective Program Analysis","abstract":"Popularity of data-driven software engineering has led to an increasing demand on the infrastructures to support efficient execution of tasks that require deeper source code analysis. While task optimization and parallelization are the adopted solutions, other research directions are less explored. We present collective program analysis (CPA), a technique for scaling large scale source code analyses, especially those that make use of control and data flow analysis, by leveraging analysis specific similarity. Analysis specific similarity is about, whether two or more programs can be considered similar for a given analysis. The key idea of collective program analysis is to cluster programs based on analysis specific similarity, such that running the analysis on one candidate in each cluster is sufficient to produce the result for others. For determining analysis specific similarity and clustering analysis-equivalent programs, we use a sparse representation and a canonical labeling scheme. Our evaluation shows that for a variety of source code analyses on a large dataset of programs, substantial reduction in the analysis time can be achieved; on average a 69% reduction when compared to a baseline and on average a 36% reduction when compared to a prior technique. We also found that a large amount of analysis-equivalent programs exists in large datasets.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Transfer functions', 'Cloning', 'Software engineering', 'Task analysis', 'Syntactics', 'Analytical models', 'Labeling'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['data flow analysis', 'pattern clustering', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['collective program analysis', 'cluster programs', 'data-driven software engineering', 'deeper source code analysis', 'scale source code analyses', 'data flow analysis'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Source code analysis', 'Clustering', 'Boa']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453131","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Ganesha Upadhyaya;Hridesh Rajan","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as \"printf debugging\" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Software', 'Tools', 'Instruments', 'Interviews', 'Computer bugs', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer debugging', 'program debugging', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['integrated development environments', 'debugging experts', 'regular debugging users', 'printf debugging', 'advanced debugging features', 'software projects', 'software engineers debug software problems', 'debugging tools', 'mixed-methods research approach'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Testing', 'WatchDog', 'IntelliJ', 'Eclipse']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453125","citationCount":2,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Moritz Beller;Niels Spruit;Diomidis Spinellis;Andy Zaidman","affiliations":"Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands;Athens Univ. of Econ. \u0026 Bus., Athens, Greece;Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8727527"},{"$numberLong":"8945610"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8789793","title":"Live interactive queries to a software application's memory profile","abstract":"Memory operations are critical to an application's reliability and performance.

To reason about their correctness and track opportunities for optimisations, sophisticated instrumentation frameworks, such as Valgrind and Pin, have been developed.

The Pico COllections Query Library (pico ql) module maps Valgrind's data structures that contain the instrumented application's memory operations metadata to a relational interface.

Over the years, many code search tools have been proposed to help developers. The existing approaches often treat source code as textual documents and utilize information retrieval models to retrieve relevant code snippets that match a given query. These approaches mainly rely on the textual similarity between source code and natural language query. They lack a deep understanding of the semantics of queries and source code. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network named CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network). Instead of matching text similarity, CODEnn jointly embeds code snippets and natural language descriptions into a high-dimensional vector space, in such a way that code snippet and its corresponding description have similar vectors. Using the unified vector representation, code snippets related to a natural language query can be retrieved according to their vectors. Semantically related words can also be recognized and irrelevant/noisy keywords in queries can be handled. As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a code search tool named DeepCS using the proposed CODEnn model. We empirically evaluate DeepCS on a large scale codebase collected from GitHub. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively retrieve relevant code snippets and outperforms previous techniques.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Natural languages', 'XML', 'Tools', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrent neural networks'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['natural language processing', 'neural nets', 'query processing', 'text analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['code search tool', 'source code', 'information retrieval models', 'relevant code snippets', 'natural language query', 'deep neural network', 'DeepCS', 'deep code search', 'large-scale codebase', 'code-description embedding neural network', 'CODEnn model', 'DeepCS', 'textual documents', 'matching text similarity'], 'Author Keywords ': ['code search', 'deep learning', 'joint embedding']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453172","citationCount":25,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Xiaodong Gu;Hongyu Zhang;Sunghun Kim","affiliations":"Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China;Univ. of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia;Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. \u0026 Technol., Hong Kong, China","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668037"},{"$numberLong":"8719437"},{"$numberLong":"8802101"},{"$numberLong":"8812134"},{"$numberLong":"8811932"},{"$numberLong":"8811893"},{"$numberLong":"8811910"},{"$numberLong":"8812062"},{"$numberLong":"8812091"},{"$numberLong":"8812051"},{"$numberLong":"8816789"},{"$numberLong":"8813290"},{"$numberLong":"8813288"},{"$numberLong":"8919234"},{"$numberLong":"8920024"},{"$numberLong":"8945662"},{"$numberLong":"8952475"},{"$numberLong":"8952546"},{"$numberLong":"8952337"},{"$numberLong":"8952168"},{"$numberLong":"8967427"},{"$numberLong":"8987482"},{"$numberLong":"8959206"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453120","title":"[Journal First] ChangeLocator: Locate Crash-Inducing Changes Based on Crash Reports","abstract":"Software crashes are severe manifestations of software bugs. Debugging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextual information for bug fixing and is highly demanded by developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes and reduces the search space of bug fix location. However, currently there are no systematic studies on locating the software changes to a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashing bugs (denoted as crashinducing changes). We also propose ChangeLocator, a method to automatically locate crash-inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach on a learning model that uses features originated from our empirical study and train the model using the data from the historical fixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release versions of Netbeans project. The results show that it can locate the crash-inducing changes for 44.7%, 68.5%, and 74.5% of the bugs by examining only top 1, 5 and 10 changes in the recommended list, respectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Computer bugs', 'Software', 'Software engineering', 'Data models', 'Computer science', 'Maintenance engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program debugging', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['historical fixed crashes', 'crashinducing changes', 'bug fix location', 'bug inducing changes', 'crashing bug', 'software bugs', 'software crashes', 'crash reports', 'crash-inducing changes'], 'Author Keywords ': ['crash-inducing change', 'software crash', 'crash stack', 'bug localization']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453120","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Rongxin Wu;Ming Wen;Shing-Chi Cheung;Hongyu Zhang","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput.

In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Uncertainty', 'Cognition', 'Semantics', 'Python', 'Tools'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['inference mechanisms', 'program debugging'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['reasoning rules', 'program semantics', 'conditional probability distributions', 'faulty statements', 'human intelligence', 'human productivity', 'single failing execution', 'substantial uncertainty', 'highly automated debugging technique', 'couple human-like reasoning', 'fusing knowledge', 'model debugging', 'probabilistic inference problem', 'executed statement instance', 'human knowledge', 'passing-failing runs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Debugging', 'Probabilistic Inference', 'Python']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453198","citationCount":1,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Zhaogui Xu;Shiqing Ma;Xiangyu Zhang;Shuofei Zhu;Baowen Xu","affiliations":"State Key Lab. of Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China;Dept. of Comput.

Most research and applications of such approach focus on N-way combinatorial testing that provides a minimum coverage of all N-way interactions among factor. However, the strengths of different interactions may not be a fixed integer N, but a variable. Therefore, variable strength combinatorial testing approach is necessary in applications. Existing variable strength combinatorial testing, which allows some interactions have a higher strength than others, has a limitation that such higher-strength interactions must be disjoint. To avoid such a limitation, an improved variable strength combinatorial testing approach, which makes a more sufficient consideration on actual interaction relationship, is proposed in this article. Furthermore, two greedy heuristic algorithms are also proposed to generate combinatorial test suite. Compared to some existing algorithms and tools, the proposed algorithms have advantages on both the execution effectiveness and the optimality of generated test suite. Experimental results can prove such advantages.","conference":"The International Conference on Quality Software","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Arrays', 'Fault currents', 'Circuit faults', 'Current transformers', 'Computed tomography', 'Algorithm design and analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['combinatorial mathematics', 'greedy algorithms', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['greedy heuristic algorithms', 'variable strength combinatorial test suite', 'software testing', 'N-way combinatorial testing'], 'Author Keywords ': ['software testing', 'combinatorial testing', 'variable strength', 'test generation']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4601539","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":4,"year":2008,"authors":"Ziyuan Wang;Baowen Xu;Changhai Nie","affiliations":";;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12c6b04a430c4a6678a3"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"5358586"},{"$numberLong":"7372037"},{"$numberLong":"5676343"},{"$numberLong":"6649874"},{"$numberLong":"7275918"},{"$numberLong":"6571649"},{"$numberLong":"7528950"},{"$numberLong":"5958995"},{"$numberLong":"5959020"},{"$numberLong":"4601539"},{"$numberLong":"5381411"},{"$numberLong":"5453905"},{"$numberLong":"8441104"},{"$numberLong":"8789816"}],"references":[{"$numberLong":"1583600"},{"$numberLong":"1319088"},{"$numberLong":"4601539"},{"$numberLong":"979992"}]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

What would it take to change your mind? That's essentially the dilemma faced by advocates of test-driven development (TDD). The TDD paradigm argues that the basic cycle of developing code and then testing it to make sure it does what it's supposed to do-something drilled into most of us from the time we began learning software development- isn't the most effective approach. TDD replaces the traditional \"code then test\" cycle. First, you develop test cases for a small increment of functionality; then you write code that makes those tests run correctly.

Decision propagation enables a backtracking-free configuration process by computing values implied by user decisions. However, employing decision propagation for large-scale systems is a time-consuming task and, thus, can be a bottleneck in interactive configuration processes and analyses alike. We propose modal implication graphs to improve the performance of decision propagation by precomputing intermediate values used in the process.

In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and De-fects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also found that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we found that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Fault detection', 'Correlation', 'Java', 'Measurement', 'Software testing', 'Software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Java', 'program testing'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mutation score', 'randomly selected test suites', 'higher mutation scores', 'mutation scores correlated', 'real fault detection', 'scale empirical study', 'empirical validation', 'software testing studies', 'mutant scores', 'test suite size', 'dependent variable the detection', 'fault detection capability'], 'Author Keywords ': ['mutation testing', 'real faults', 'test suite effectiveness']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453121","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Mike Papadakis;Donghwan Shin;Shin Yoo;Doo-Hwan Bae","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8730152"},{"$numberLong":"8735019"},{"$numberLong":"8919245"},{"$numberLong":"8952421"},{"$numberLong":"8705674"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

A common repair approach is to iteratively first generate candidate programs with possible bug fixes and then validate them against the given tests until a candidate that passes all the tests is found. While this approach is conceptually simple, due to the potentially high number of candidates that need to first be generated and then be compiled and tested, existing repair techniques that embody this approach have relatively low effectiveness, especially for faults at a fine granularity. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a novel repair technique, SketchFix, which generates candidate fixes on demand (as needed) during the test execution. Instead of iteratively re-compiling and re-executing each actual candidate program, SketchFix translates faulty programs to sketches, i.e., partial programs with \"holes\", and compiles each sketch once which may represent thousands of concrete candidates. With the insight that the space of candidates can be reduced substantially by utilizing the runtime behaviors of the tests, SketchFix lazily initializes the candidates of the sketches while validating them against the test execution. We experimentally evaluate SketchFix on the Defects4J benchmark and the experimental results show that SketchFix works particularly well in repairing bugs with expression manipulation at the AST node-level granularity compared to other program repair techniques. Specifically, SketchFix correctly fixes 19 out of 357 defects in 23 minutes on average using the default setting. In addition, SketchFix finds the first repair with 1.6% of re-compilations (#compiled sketches/#candidates) and 3.0% of re-executions out of all repair candidates.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Maintenance engineering', 'Computer bugs', 'Runtime', 'Syntactics', 'Debugging', 'Java'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program compilers', 'program debugging', 'program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'software fault tolerance', 'software maintenance'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['effective program repair techniques', 'faulty programs', 'manual debugging', 'common repair approach', 'candidate programs', 'possible bug fixes', 'relatively low effectiveness', 'novel repair technique', 'SketchFix', 'candidate fixes', 'test execution', 'iteratively re-compiling', 're-executing each actual candidate program', 'partial programs', 'concrete candidates', 're-compilations', 'repair candidates', 'practical program repair', 'on-demand candidate generation', '#compiled sketches-#candidates'], 'Author Keywords ': ['debugging', 'program repair', 'program synthesis', 'lazy initialization', 'execution driven pruning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453056","citationCount":14,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Jinru Hua;Mengshi Zhang;Kaiyuan Wang;Sarfraz Khurshid","affiliations":"Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA;Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8665493"},{"$numberLong":"8665475"},{"$numberLong":"8667970"},{"$numberLong":"8719533"},{"$numberLong":"8730164"},{"$numberLong":"8802763"},{"$numberLong":"8802695"},{"$numberLong":"8812056"},{"$numberLong":"8870172"},{"$numberLong":"8952355"},{"$numberLong":"8952486"},{"$numberLong":"8952344"},{"$numberLong":"8952210"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

A major challenge faced by testers lies in crafting efficient test suites, able to detect a maximum number of bugs with manageable effort. To do so, they rely on coverage criteria, which define some precise test objectives to be covered. However, many common criteria specify a significant number of objectives that occur to be infeasible or redundant in practice, like covering dead code or semantically equal mutants. Such objectives are well-known to be harmful to the design of test suites, impacting both the efficiency and precision of the tester's effort. This work introduces a sound and scalable technique to prune out a significant part of the infeasible and redundant objectives produced by a panel of white-box criteria. In a nutshell, we reduce this task to proving the validity of logical assertions in the code under test. The technique is implemented in a tool that relies on weakest-precondition calculus and SMT solving for proving the assertions. The tool is built on top of the Frama-C verification platform, which we carefully tune for our specific scalability needs. The experiments reveal that the pruning capabilities of the tool can reduce the number of targeted test objectives in a program by up to 27% and scale to real programs of 200K lines, making it possible to automate a painstaking part of their current testing process.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Tools', 'Software safety', 'Security', 'Software testing', 'Scalability'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['program diagnostics', 'program testing', 'program verification'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['significant number', 'dead code', 'semantically equal mutants', 'scalable technique', 'infeasible objectives', 'redundant objectives', 'white-box criteria', 'logical assertions', 'targeted test objectives', 'current testing process', 'primary approach', 'detecting software defects', 'efficient test suites', 'coverage criteria', 'precise test objectives'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Coverage Criteria', 'Infeasible Objectives', 'Redundant Objectives']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453106","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Michaël Marcozzi;Sébastien Bardin;Nikolai Kosmatov;Mike Papadakis;Virgile Prevosto;Loïc Correnson","affiliations":"Dept. of Comput., Imperial Coll.

Firstly, there are potentially two different standardized mean difference effect sizes that can be calculated, depending on whether the mean difference is standardized by the pooled within groups variance or the within-participants variance. Hence, we provided equations for non-standardized and standardized effect sizes and explained the need for two different types of standardized effect size, one for the repeated measures and one that would be equivalent to an independent groups design. Secondly, as for any estimated parameters and also for the purposes of undertaking meta-analysis, it is necessary to calculate the variance of the standardized mean difference effect sizes (which is not the same as the variance of the study). Hence, we provided formulas for the small sample size effect size variance and the medium sample size approximation to the effect size variance, for both types of standardized effect size. We also presented the model underlying the AB/BA crossover design and provided two examples (an empirical analysis of the real data set by Scanniello, as well as simulated data) to demonstrate how to construct the two standardized mean difference effect sizes and their variances, both from standard descriptive statistics and from the outputs provided by the linear mixed model package lme4 in R. A conclusion is that crossover designs should be considered (instead of between groups design) only if:  previous research has suggested that  is greater than zero and preferably greater than 0.25;  there is either strong theoretical argument, or empirical evidence from a well-powered study, that the period by technique interaction is negligible. Summarizing, our journal first paper [3]: (1) Presents the formulas needed to calculate both non-standardized and standardized mean difference effect sizes for AB/BA crossover designs (see Section 4 and 5 of our paper [3]). (2) Presents the formulas needed to estimate the variances of the non-standardized and standardized effect sizes which in the later cases need to be appropriate for the small to medium sample sizes commonly used in software engineering crossover designs (see Section 5 of our paper [3]). (3) Explains how to calculate the effect sizes and their variances both from the descriptive statistics that should be reported and from the raw data (see Section 6 of our paper [3]). It is worth mentioning that we based our formulas on our own corrections to the formulas presented earlier by Curtin et al. [1]. Our corrections for the variances of standardized weighted mean difference of an AB/BA cross-over trial were accepted by the author of the original formulas (Curtin), submitted jointly as a letter to Editor of Statistics in Medicine to assure the widespread (also beyond the software engineering domain) adoption of the corrected formulas, and accepted [2]. We proposed an alternative formulation of the standardized effect size for individual difference effects that is comparable with the standardized effect size commonly used for pretest/posttest studies. We also corrected the small sample size and moderate sample size variances reported by Curtin et al. for both the individual difference effect size and the standardized effect size comparable to independent groups trials, showing the derivation of the formulas from the variance of at-variable. Using these results, researchers can now correctly calculate standardized effect size variances, allowing the calculation of confidence intervals for AB/BA cross-over trials, which in turn provides a direct link to null hypothesis testing and supports meta-analysis. Meta-analysts can now validly aggregate together results from independent groups, pretest/posttest and AB/BA cross-over trials. Last but not least, the presented contributions allow corrections of previously reported results.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software engineering', 'Size measurement', 'Analytical models', 'Data models', 'Standards', 'Clinical trials', 'Computer science'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['medical computing', 'software engineering', 'statistical analysis'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['standardized mean difference effect sizes', 'standardized weighted mean difference', 'sample size effect size variance', 'medium sample size approximation', 'difference effect size', 'AB-BA crossover design', 'software engineering literature', 'meta-analysis', 'standard descriptive statistics', 'linear mixed model package', 'null hypothesis testing', 'posttest studies', 'pretest studies', 'software engineering crossover designs'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical software engineering', 'Meta-analysis', 'Effect size']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453101","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lech Madeyski;Barbara Kitchenham","affiliations":"Fac. of Comput.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Testing', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Computer bugs', 'Tools', 'Google'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['Android (operating system)', 'dynamic testing', 'mobile computing', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'public domain software'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['unique exception', 'open-source Android apps', 'framework-specific exceptions', 'bug detection techniques', 'real-world apps', 'identified exceptions', 'confirmed/fixed crashes', 'exception localization tool', 'dynamic testing tool', 'mobile apps', 'four-month long effort', 'analysis tools', 'real-world app crashes', 'frequent crashes', 'app developers'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Empirical study', 'mobile app bugs', 'testing', 'static analysis']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453100","citationCount":15,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Lingling Fan;Ting Su;Sen Chen;Guozhu Meng;Yang Liu;Lihua Xu;Geguang Pu;Zhendong Su","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Graphical user interfaces', 'Skeleton', 'Layout', 'Visualization', 'Feature extraction', 'Tools', 'Task analysis'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer bootstrapping', 'computer vision', 'graphical user interfaces', 'language translation', 'mobile computing', 'neural nets'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['large-scale UI data', 'GUI exploration method', 'GUI components', 'computer vision', 'GUI generation rules', 'heuristically-designed visual understanding', 'bootstrap mobile GUI implementation', 'neural machine translator', 'GUI skeleton', 'UI design image'], 'Author Keywords ': ['User interface', 'reverse engineering', 'deep learning']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453135","citationCount":9,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Chunyang Chen;Ting Su;Guozhu Meng;Zhenchang Xing;Yang Liu","affiliations":"Sch. of Comput.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Malware', 'Servers', 'Security', 'Databases', 'Static analysis', 'Feature extraction'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['invasive software', 'mobile computing', 'program diagnostics'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['mobile-app behaviors', 'EnMobile', 'benign apps', 'entity-based characterization', 'modern mobile malware', 'mobile platform', 'modern mobile apps'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Program Analysis', 'Mobile Security']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453096","citationCount":5,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Wei Yang;Mukul Prasad;Tao Xie","affiliations":";Fujitsu Labs. of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8816783"},{"$numberLong":"8913874"},{"$numberLong":"8952382"},{"$numberLong":"8952509"},{"$numberLong":"8967416"}],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, there is no consensus on which type of representation better supports the comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey's cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies performed in two countries with 69 and 83 participants respectively, in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models. Conclusions: Our findings can be explained by Vessey's cognitive fit theory as tabular models implicitly capture elementary linear spatial relationships.

When OCL constraints evolve in a regular basis, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) and four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) which are encoded as potential solutions for search algorithms. A solution is therefore an optimal sequence of refactoring operators, which are sequentially applied to the original set of OCL constraints to automatically obtain a semantically equivalent set of OCL constraints with better understandability and maintainability in terms of Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil\u0026Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and improve 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained encouraging results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Software', 'Security', 'Androids', 'Humanoid robots', 'Libraries', 'Software protection', 'Manuals'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['computer crime', 'security of data', 'smart phones', 'software engineering'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['software protection', 'large-scale empirical study', 'smartphone markets', 'mobile platforms', 'effective software obfuscation techniques', 'mobile ecosystems', 'desktop ecosystems', 'nontechnical challenges', 'software security solution providers', 'mobile app obfuscation services', 'real-world mobile developers', 'mobile obfuscation', 'Apple App Store', 'million app samples', 'mobile software development', 'software engineering practices'], 'Author Keywords ': ['obfuscation', 'reverse engineering', 'mobile app', 'empirical study']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453059","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Pei Wang;Qinkun Bao;Li Wang;Shuai Wang;Zhaofeng Chen;Tao Wei;Dinghao Wu","affiliations":";;;;;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[],"references":[]}],"_class":"com.example.oasisdocument.model.docs.analysis.AuthorCitation"}

However, there is no consensus on which type of representation better supports the comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey's cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies performed in two countries with 69 and 83 participants respectively, in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models. Conclusions: Our findings can be explained by Vessey's cognitive fit theory as tabular models implicitly capture elementary linear spatial relationships.

Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Cancer', 'Unified modeling language', 'Complexity theory', 'Couplings', 'Software engineering', 'Semantics', 'Measurement'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['evolutionary computation', 'object-oriented programming', 'search problems', 'software maintenance', 'Unified Modeling Language'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['cancer registries', 'automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach', 'OCL quality metrics', 'semantics-preserving refactoring operators', 'search algorithms', 'Cancer Registry', 'original OCL constraint', 'original constraint set', 'object constraint language constraints'], 'Author Keywords ': ['Refactoring', 'Search', 'Object Constraint Language']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453206","citationCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Hong Lu;Shuai Wang;Tao Yue;Shaukat Ali;Jan Nygard","affiliations":"Simula Res.

In this paper, we investigate how and why quasi-contributors (external developers who did not succeed in getting their contributions accepted to an OSS project) fail. To achieve our goal, we collected data from 21 popular, non-trivial GitHub projects, identified quasi-contributors, and analyzed their pull-requests. In addition, we conducted surveys with quasi-contributors, and projects' integrators, to understand their perceptions about nonacceptance.We found 10,099 quasi-contributors - about 70% of the total actual contributors - that submitted 12,367 non-accepted pull-requests. In five projects, we found more quasi-contributors than actual contributors. About one-third of the developers who took our survey disagreed with the nonacceptance, and around 30% declared the nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request. The main reasons for pull-request nonacceptance from the quasi-contributors' perspective were \"superseded/duplicated pull-request\" and \"mismatch between developer's and team's vision/opinion.\" A manual analysis of a representative sample of 263 pull-requests corroborated with this finding. We also found reasons related to the relationship with the community and lack of experience or commitment from the quasi-contributors. This empirical study is particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers' participation and retention in OSS communities.","conference":"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering","terms":"{'IEEE Keywords': ['Open source software', 'Computer languages', 'Software engineering', 'Face', 'Analytical models', 'Encoding'], 'INSPEC: Controlled Indexing': ['project management', 'public domain software', 'software management'], 'INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing': ['OSS project', 'open-source software projects', 'manual analysis', 'quasicontributors', 'GitHub projects'], 'Author Keywords ': ['pull-requests', 'quasi contributors', 'newcomers', 'open source software']}","keywords":"","pdfLink":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453084","citationCount":8,"referenceCount":0,"year":2018,"authors":"Igor Steinmacher;Gustavo Pinto;Igor Scaliante Wiese;Marco Aurélio Gerosa","affiliations":";;;","authorList":[],"conferenceEntity":{"$ref":"conferences","$id":{"$oid":"5e7a12edb04a430c4a667a15"}},"citations":[{"$numberLong":"8668023"},{"$numberLong":"8797633"},{"$numberLong":"8802111"},{"$numberLong":"8811892"},{"$numberLong":"8816766"},{"$numberLong":"8823598"},{"$numberLong":"8935866"},{"$numberLong":"8952395"}],"references":[]},{"_id":"8453116","title":"How Modern News Aggregators Help Development Communities Shape and Share Knowledge","abstract":"Many developers rely on modern news aggregator sites such as reddit and hn to stay up to date with the latest technological developments and trends. In order to understand what motivates developers to contribute, what kind of content is shared, and how knowledge is shaped by the community, we interviewed and surveyed developers that participate on the reddit programming subreddit and we analyzed a sample of posts on both reddit and hn. We learned what kind of content is shared in these websites and developer motivations for posting, sharing, discussing, evaluating, and aggregating knowledge on these aggregators, while revealing challenges developers face in terms of how content and participant behavior is moderated.
